  <h2 class='c003'>THE <i>DOCTRINES</i> OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION EXPLAINED AND DEFENDED.</h2>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c011'>Quest. LXV., LXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXV.</span> <i>What special benefits do the members of the
invisible church enjoy by Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The members of the invisible church, by Christ, enjoy
union and communion with him in grace and glory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXVI.</span> <i>What is that union which the elect have with
Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The union which the elect have with Christ, is the
work of God’s grace, whereby they are spiritually and mystically,
yet really and inseparably joined to Christ, as their
head and husband, which is done in their effectual calling.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have, in the foregoing part of this work, considered
man as made upright at first; but not continuing in
that state, plunged into those depths of sin and misery, which
would have rendered his state altogether desperate, without
the interposition of a Mediator; whose designation to this work,
his fitness for, and faithful discharge thereof, have been particularly
considered in several foregoing answers, wherein we
have had an account of his Person as God-man; his offices of
Prophet, Priest, and King, his twofold estate, to wit, of humiliation
and exaltation; and the benefits which accrue to the
church thereby. This church has also been considered as <i>visible</i>
or <i>invisible</i>; and the former of these, as enjoying many privileges
which respect, more especially, the ordinary means of
salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now led to consider the benefits which the members
of the <i>invisible</i> church, to wit, the whole number of the elect,
who have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under
Christ, their head, enjoy by him. And these are contained in
two general heads; namely, union and communion with him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>grace and glory; which comprise in them the blessings of both
worlds, as the result of their relation to, and interest in him.
First, they are united to him, and then made partakers of his
benefits. All grace imparted to us here, is the result thereof;
as the apostle says, <i>Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God
is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,
and redemption</i>, 1 Cor. i. 30. And elsewhere our Saviour says,
<i>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth
much fruit</i>, John xv. 5. And the contrary hereunto is inconsistent
with the exercise of any grace: <i>Without me ye can do
nothing</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, that communion which the saints have with
Christ in glory, whereby they who are brought to a state of
perfection, participate of those graces and comforts which flow
from their continued union with him; and the first fruits, or
foretastes of glory, which they have in this world, are also
founded on it. Thus the apostle calls Christ in his people, <i>The
hope of glory</i>, Colos. i. 27. and speaking of his giving eternal
life to them, he considers them as being <i>in his hand</i>, from
whence <i>none shall pluck them out</i>, John x. 28. or separate them
from him. So that they shall enjoy everlasting happiness with
him, inasmuch as they shall <i>be found in him</i>, Phil. iii. 9. which
leads us more particularly to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>What this union with Christ is. The scripture often speaks
of Christ’s being, or abiding in his people, and they in him;
and assigns it as an evidence of their interest in the blessings
he has purchased for them: and, indeed, it is from hence that
all internal and practical godliness is derived.</p>

<p class='c006'>This privilege argues infinite condescension in him, and
tends to the highest advancement of those who are the subjects
thereof. Now that we may understand what is intended thereby,
let us take heed that we do not include in it any thing that
tends to extenuate it on the one hand; or to exalt those who
are made partakers of it above the station or condition into
which they are brought thereby, on the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not sufficient to suppose that this union contains in it
no more than that his people have the same kind of nature with
him, as being made <i>partakers of flesh and blood</i>; he having
<i>himself taken part of the same</i>, Heb. ii. 14. He is indeed allied
to us, as having all the essential perfections of our nature: and
this was an instance of infinite condescension in him, and absolutely
necessary to our redemption: nevertheless, this similitude
of nature; abstracted from other considerations, accompanying
or flowing from his incarnation, contains in it no other
idea of union, between Christ and his people, than that which
they have with one another; nor is it a privilege peculiar to
believers, since Christ took on him the same human nature that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>all men have, though with a peculiar design of grace to those
whom he came to redeem. This I the rather take notice of,
because the Socinians, and others, that speak of this privilege,
inasmuch as it is often mentioned in scripture, appear to have
very low thoughts of it, when they suppose nothing more than
this to be intended thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, this union includes in it more than what is contained
in that mutual love that is between Christ and believers, in
that sense in which there is an union of affection between those
who love one another; as it is said, <i>The soul of Jonathan was
knit with the soul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his
own soul</i>, 1 Sam. xviii. 1. In which respect believers are united
to one another; or, as the apostle expresses it, their hearts
are <i>knit together in love</i>, Col. ii. 2. <i>being like minded, having
the same love, being of one accord, of one mind</i>, Phil. ii. 2. or,
as he adds, <i>Let this mind also be in you, which was also in
Christ Jesus</i>, ver. 5. I say it includes more than this, which
is rather the fruit and consequence of our union with Christ,
than that wherein it principally consists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover we must take heed that we do not, in explaining
this union between Christ and believers, include more in it than
what belongs to creatures infinitely below him, to whom they
are said to be united: therefore we cannot but abhor the blasphemy
of those who speak of an essential union of creatures
with God; or, as though they had hereby something derived
to them in common with Christ the great Mediator.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But passing by this method of accounting for the union between
Christ and believers, there are two senses in which it is
taken in scripture; one is, that which results from Christ’s being
their federal head, representative, or surety; having undertaken
to deal with the justice of God in their behalf, so that
what he should do, as standing in this relation to them, should
be placed to their account, as much as though it had been done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>by them in their own persons: this is what contains in it their
concern in the covenant of grace, made with him in their behalf;
of which something has been said under a foregoing answer;<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
and it is the foundation of their sins being imputed to
him, and his righteousness to them; which will be farther considered,
when we treat of the doctrine of justification under a
following answer.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore this union with Christ, which is mentioned in the
answer we are now explaining, is of another nature, and, in
some respects, may be properly styled a <i>vital union</i>, as all spiritual
life is derived from it; or a <i>conjugal union</i>, as it is founded
in consent, and said to be by faith. Now there are two
things observed concerning it.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is expressed by our being spiritually and mystically
joined to Christ: it is styled a <i>spiritual</i> union, in opposition to
those gross and carnal conceptions which persons may entertain
concerning things being joined together in a natural way;
and, indeed, whatever respects salvation is of a spiritual nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is moreover called a <i>mystical</i> union, which is the word
most used by those who treat on this subject; and the reason
is, because the apostle calls it <i>a great mystery</i>, Eph. v. 32. by
which we are not to understand the union there is between man
and wife, as contained in the similitude by which he had before
illustrated this doctrine, as the Papists pretend,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> but the
union that there is between Christ and his church. And it is
probably styled <i>a mystery</i>, because it could never have been
known without divine revelation: and as Christ’s condescension,
expressed herein, can never be sufficiently admired; so
it cannot be fully comprehended by us. This is such a nearness
to him, and such a display of love in him <i>as passeth knowledge</i>.
However, there are some similitudes used in scripture
to illustrate it. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The union that there is between the <i>vine</i> and the <i>branches</i>,
John xv. 1, 2, 5. whereby life, nourishment, growth and fruitfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>are conveyed to them: in like manner all our spiritual
life together, with the exercise and increase of grace, depend
on our union with, abiding in, and deriving what is necessary
thereunto, from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is also compared to the union there is between the
<i>head</i> and <i>members</i>, as the apostle farther illustrates it, when he
styles <i>him the head, from which all the body, by joints and
bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth
with the increase of God</i>, Col. ii. 19. which is a very
beautiful similitude, whereby we are given to understand, that
as the head is the fountain of life and motion to the whole body,
as the nerves and animal spirits take their rise from thence, so
that if the communication that there is between them and it,
be stopped, the members would be useless, dead, and insignificant:
so Christ is the fountain of spiritual life and motion, to
all those who are united to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) This union is farther illustrated, by a similitude taken
from that union which there is between the foundation and the
building; and accordingly Christ is styled, in scripture, <i>the
chief corner stone</i>, Eph. ii. 20. and a <i>sure foundation</i>, Isa.
xxviii. 16. And there is something peculiar in that phrase
which the apostle uses, which is more than any similitude can
express; when he speaks of Christ as the <i>living stone</i>, or rock,
on which the church is built; and of believers, as <i>lively stones</i>,
1 Pet. ii. 4, 5. to denote, that they are not only supported and
upheld by him, as the building is by the foundation, but enabled
to put forth living actions, as those whose life is derived
from this union with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) There is another similitude taken from that nourishment
which the body receives, by the use of food; and therefore
our Saviour styles himself the <i>bread of life</i>, or the <i>bread
which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
and not die</i>; and proceeds to speak of his <i>giving his flesh for
the life of the world</i>; and adds, <i>he that eateth my flesh and
drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him</i>, John vi. 48-56.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) There is another similitude, by which our being united
to Christ by faith, is more especially illustrated, taken from
the union which there is between man and wife; accordingly
this is generally styled, a conjugal union, between Christ and
believers. Thus the prophet says, <i>Thy Maker is thine Husband,
the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the holy
One of Israel</i>, Isa. liv. 5. And the apostle, speaking of a man’s
<i>leaving his father and mother, and being joined unto his wife,
and they two being one flesh</i>, Eph. v. 31, 32. applies it, as
was before observed, to the union that there is between Christ
and the church; and adds, that <i>we are members of his body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of his flesh, and of his bones</i>, ver. 30. which expression, if not
compared with other scriptures, would be very hard to be understood;
but it may be explained by the like phraseology,
used elsewhere. Thus, when God formed Eve at first, and
brought her to Adam, and thereby joined them together in a
conjugal relation: he says upon this occasion, <i>This is now
bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</i>, Gen. ii. 23. And we
find also, that other relations, which are more remote than this,
are expressed by the same mode of speaking. Thus Laban
says to Jacob, <i>Surely thou art my bone and my flesh</i>, Gen. xxix.
14. And Abimelech pleading the relation he stood in to the
men of Shechem, as a pretence of his right to reign over them,
tells them, <i>I am your bone and your flesh</i>, Judges ix. 2. Therefore
the apostle makes use of the same expression, agreeably
to the common mode of speaking used in scripture, to set forth
the conjugal relation which there is between Christ and believers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The apostle, indeed, elsewhere alters the phrase, when he
says, <i>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 17.
which is so difficult an expression, that some who treat on this
subject, though concluding that there is in it something that
denotes the intimacy and nearness of this union, and more than
what is contained in the other phrase, of their <i>being one flesh</i>,
nevertheless, reckon it among those expressions which are inexplicable;
though I cannot but give into the sense in which
some understand it; namely, that inasmuch as the same Spirit
dwells in believers that dwelt in Christ, though with different
views and designs, they are hereby wrought up, in their measure,
to the same temper and disposition; or as it is expressed
elsewhere, <i>The same mind</i> is in them <i>that</i> was <i>in Christ</i>, Phil.
ii. 5. which is such an effect of this conjugal relation that there
is between him and them, as is not always the result of the
same relation amongst men. The reason why I call this our
being united to Christ, by faith, is because it is founded in a
mutual consent; as <i>the Lord avouches them</i> on the one hand,
<i>to be his people</i>, so they, on the other hand, <i>avouch him to be
their God</i>, Deut. xxvi. 17, 18. the latter of which is, properly
speaking, an act of faith; whereby they give up themselves
to be his servants, to all intents and purposes, and that for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is farther observed in this answer. That union with Christ
is a work of God’s grace: this it must certainly be, since it is
the spring and fountain from whence all acts of grace proceed;
and indeed, from the nature of the thing, it cannot be otherwise:
for if there be a wonderful instance of condescending
grace in God’s conferring those blessings that accompany salvation;
this may much more be deemed so. If Christ be pleased
to <i>dwell</i> with, and <i>in</i> his people, and to <i>walk</i> <i>in</i> them, 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Cor. vi. 16. or as it is said elsewhere, to <i>live in them</i>, Gal. ii.
20. as a pledge and earnest of their being forever with him in
heaven; and if, as the result hereof, they be admitted to the
greatest intimacy with him; we may from hence take occasion
to apply what was spoken by one of Christ’s disciples, to
him, with becoming humility and admiration; <i>how is it that
thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</i>
John xiv. 22. Is it not a great instance of grace, that the Son
of God should make choice of so mean an habitation, as that
of the souls of sinful men; and not only be present with, but
united to them in those instances which have been before considered?</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is farther observed in this answer, that we are united
to Christ in effectual calling; which leads us to consider what
is contained in the two following answers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-67' class='c003'>Quest. LXVII., LXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXVII.</span> <i>What is effectual calling?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Effectual calling is the work of God’s almighty power
and grace; whereby, out of his free and special love to his
elect, and from nothing in them moving him thereunto, he
doth, in his accepted time, invite and draw them to Jesus
Christ by his word and Spirit, savingly enlightening their
minds, renewing, and powerfully determining their wills;
so as they, although in themselves dead in sin, are hereby
made willing and able, freely to answer his call, and to accept
and embrace the grace offered and conveyed therein.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXVIII.</span> <i>Are the elect effectually called?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> All the elect, and they only, are effectually called; although
others may be, and often are, outwardly called by the
ministry of the word, and have some common operations of
the Spirit; who, for their wilful neglect and contempt of the
grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do
never truly come to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have, in these answers, an account of the first step
that God takes, in applying the redemption purchased
by Christ; which is expressed, in general, by the word <i>calling</i>;
whereby sinners are invited, commanded, encouraged, and enabled,
to come to Christ, in order to their being made partakers
of his benefits: the apostle styles it an <i>high</i>, <i>holy</i>, and <i>heavenly
calling</i>, Phil. iii. 14. 2 Tim. i. 9. Heb. iii. 1. and a being <i>called
unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord</i>, 1 Cor. i.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>8. Herein we are <i>called out of darkness into his marvellous light</i>,
1 Pet. ii. 9. and <i>to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ</i>, chap. v.
10. And, indeed, the word is very emphatical: For,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A call supposes a person to be separate, or at a distance
from him that calls him; and it contains an intimation of leave
to come into his presence. Thus, in effectual calling, he who
was departed from God, is brought nigh to him. God, as it
were, says to him, as he did to Adam, when flying from him,
and dreading nothing so much as his presence, when apprehending
himself exposed to the stroke of his vindictive justice,
<i>Where art thou?</i> Gen. iii. 9. which is styled, <i>God’s calling unto
him</i>. Or, it is like as when a traveller is taking a wrong way,
and in danger of falling into some pit, or snare; and a kind
friend calls after him to return, and sets him in the right way:
thus God calls to sinners, or says, as the prophet expresses it;
<i>Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when
ye turn to the left</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Herein God deals with men as reasonable creatures;
which is by no means to be excluded from our ideas of the
work of grace; though this work contain in it some superior,
or supernatural methods of acting, in order to bring it about;
yet we may be under a divine influence, as turning to God, or
effectually called by him, and accordingly acted by a supernatural
principle; and at the same time our understandings, or
reasoning powers, not rendered useless, but enlightened or improved
thereby; by which means, every thing that we do, in
obedience to the call of God, appears to be most just and reasonable.
This gives no ground for any one to conclude, that,
according to our method of explaining this doctrine, we lay
ourselves open to the absurd consequence fastened upon it; as
though God dealt with us as stocks and stones: but more of
this may be considered under a following head.</p>

<p class='c006'>We now proceed, more particularly, to consider the subject-matter
of these two answers; wherein we have an account of
the difference between the <i>external</i> call of the gospel, which is
explained in the latter of them, and the <i>internal</i>, saving, and
powerful call, which is justly termed <i>effectual</i>; and is considered
in the former of them. And,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, Concerning the outward and common call, together
with the persons to whom it is given; the design of God in
giving it, and also the issue thereof, with respect to a great
number of those who are said to be called.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reason why we choose to insist on this common call, in
the first place, is because it is antecedent, and made subservient
to the other in the method of the divine dispensation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>inasmuch as we are first favoured with the word and ordinances,
and then they are made effectual to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Therefore we shall consider what we are to understand
by this common call.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is observed, that it is by the ministry of the word, in which
Christ is set forth in his person and offices, and sinners are
called to come to him; and in so doing, to be made partakers
of the blessings which he has purchased. This is the sum and
substance of the gospel-ministry; and it is illustrated Matt.
xxii. 1, &amp; <i>seq.</i> by the parable of the <i>marriage-feast</i>, which the
<i>king made for his son, and sent his servants</i>; by which is signified
gospel-ministers, to <i>call</i> or invite, and therein to use all
persuasive arguments to prevail with persons to come to it:
this is styled their being <i>called</i>. And the observation made on
persons refusing to comply with this call, when it is said, <i>Many
are called, but few are chosen</i>, ver. 14. plainly intimates, that our
Saviour here means no other than a common or ineffectual call.
And in another parable it is illustrated by an <i>householder’s
hiring labourers into his vineyard</i>, Matt. xx. 1, &amp; <i>seq.</i> at several
hours of the day: some were hired early in the morning, at
the <i>third hour</i>; others at the <i>sixth</i> and <i>ninth</i>; which denotes
the gospel-call, that the Jewish church had to come to Christ
before his incarnation, under the ceremonial law; and others
were hired at the <i>eleventh</i> hour, denoting those who were called,
at that time, by the ministry of Christ and his disciples:
that this was only a common and external call, is evident, not
only from the intimation that they, who had <i>borne the burden
and heat of the day</i>; that is, for many ages had been a professing
people, <i>murmured</i>, because others, who were called at the
eleventh hour, had an equal share in his regard; but also from
what is expressly said, (the words are the same with those
wherewith the other parable before-mentioned, is closed) <i>Many
are called, but few are chosen</i>, ver. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the apostle intends this common call, when he
speaks of some who have been <i>called into the grace of Christ</i>;
not called by the power and efficacious grace of Christ, as denoting
that the call was effectual; but called, or invited to come
and receive the grace of Christ; or called externally, and thereby
prevailed on to embrace the doctrine of the grace of Christ:
these are said to be <i>soon removed unto another gospel</i>, Gal. i. 6.
And elsewhere, chap. v. 7. he speaks of some, who, when <i>the
truth</i>, or the doctrines of the gospel, were first presented to
them, expressed, for a time, a readiness to receive it; upon
which account he says, <i>Ye did run well</i>, or, ye began well; but
yet they did not afterwards yield the obedience of faith, to that
truth which they seemed, at first, to have a very great regard:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>upon which occasion the apostle says, <i>This persuasion cometh
not of him that calleth you</i>, ver. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>They who express some regard to this call, are generally
said to have <i>common</i> grace, as contradistinguished from others,
who are under the powerful, and efficacious influences of the
Spirit, which are styled <i>special</i>. The former of these are oftentimes
under some impressive influences by the common work
of the Spirit, under the preaching of the gospel; who, notwithstanding,
are in an unconverted state; their consciences are
sometimes awakened, and they bring many charges and accusations
against themselves; and from a dread of the consequences
thereof, abstain from many enormous crimes, as well
as practise several duties of religion; they are also said to be
made partakers of some great degrees of restraining grace;
and all this arises from no other than the Spirit’s common work
of conviction; as he is said, <i>to reprove the world of sin</i>, John
xvi. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are styled, in this answer, the common operations of
the Spirit: they may be called operations, inasmuch as they
contain in them something more than God’s sending ministers
to address themselves to sinners, in a way of persuasion or
arguing; for, the Spirit of God deals with their consciences
under the ministry of the word. It is true, this is no more than
common grace; yet it may be styled the Spirit’s work: for
though the call be no other than common, and the Spirit considered
as an external agent, inasmuch as he never dwells in
the hearts of any but believers, yet the effect produced, is internal
in the mind and consciences of men, and, in some degree,
in the will; which is almost persuaded to comply with it.
These operations are sometimes called the Spirit’s <i>striving with
man</i>, Gen. vi. 3. but inasmuch as many of these internal motions
are said to be resisted and quenched, when persons first
act contrary to the dictates of their consciences, and afterwards
wholly extinguish them; therefore the Spirit’s work in those
whom he thus calls, is not effectual or saving; these are not
united to Christ by his Spirit, nor by faith; and this is generally
styled common grace, in speaking to which, we shall
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That there are some things presented to us, in an objective
way, which contain the subject matter of the gospel, or
that call, which is given to sinners to pursue those methods,
which, by divine appointment, lead to salvation. As <i>faith cometh
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</i>, Rom. x. 17.
so do common convictions, and whatever carries in it the appearance
of grace in the unregenerate. In this respect God
deals with men as intelligent creatures, capable of making such
improvement of those instructions and intimations, as may tend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in many respects, to their advantage. This must be supposed,
or else the preaching of the gospel could not be reckoned an
universal blessing to them who are favoured with it, abstracting
from those saving advantages which some are to receive
hereby. This is here called the grace which is offered to them,
who are outwardly called, by the ministry of the word.</p>

<p class='c006'>Offers of grace, and invitations to come to Christ, are words
used by almost all who have treated on this subject: though
some, of late, have been ready to conclude, that these modes
of speaking tend to overthrow the doctrine we are maintaining;
for they argue to this purpose; that an overture, or invitation,
supposes a power in him to whom it is given to comply with
it. Did I think this idea necessarily contained in these words,
I should rather choose to substitute others in the room of them:
however, to remove prejudices, or unjust representations, which
the use thereof may occasion, either here or elsewhere, I shall
briefly give an account of the reason why I use them, and what
I understand thereby. If it be said, This mode of speaking is
not to be found in scripture; this, it is true, should make us
less tenacious of it. Nevertheless, it may be used without just
offence given, if it be explained agreeably thereunto.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Therefore
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>(2.) That the presenting an object, whatever it be, to the
understanding and will, is generally called, an <i>offering</i> it; as
God says to David, from the Lord; <i>I offer thee three things,
choose thee one of them</i>, &amp;c. 1 Sam. xxiv. 12. So if God sets
before us life and death, blessing and cursing, and bids us
choose which we will have; this is equivalent to what is generally
called, an offer of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for invitations to come to Christ, it is plain, that there
are many scriptures that speak to that purpose; namely, when
it is said, <i>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto
me and drink</i>, John vii. 37. And, <i>Ho every one that thirsteth,
come ye to the waters</i>, Isa. lv. 1. And elsewhere Christ says,
<i>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest</i>, Matt. xi. 28. And, <i>Let him that is athirst come;
and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely</i>,
Rev. xxii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) When an offer, or invitation to accept of a thing, thus
objectively presented to us, is made, it always supposes the
valuableness thereof; and how much it would be our interest
to accept of it; and that it is our indispensable duty so to do;
which are the principal ideas that I intend, in my sense of the
word, when I speak of offers of grace in the gospel, or invitations
to come to Christ. Nevertheless, taking them in this
sense, does not necessarily infer a power in us to accept them,
without the assistance of divine grace: thus it may be said,
that Christ came into the world to save sinners; and that he
will certainly apply the redemption, which he has purchased,
to all, for whom this price was given; and also, that a right to
salvation is inseparably connected with faith and repentance;
and that these, and all other graces are God’s gifts; and that
we are to pray, wait, and hope for them, under the ministry of
the word; and if we be, in God’s own time and way, enabled
to exercise these graces, this will be our unspeakable advantage:
and therefore it cannot but be our duty to attend upon
God in all his holy institutions, in hope of saving blessings:
these things may be done; and consequently the gospel may be
thus preached, without supposing that grace is in our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>power: and this is what we principally intend by gospel-overtures
or invitations.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Nevertheless we cannot approve of some expressions
subversive of the doctrine of special redemption, how moving
and pathetic soever they may appear to be; as when any one,
to induce sinners to come to Christ, tells them, that God is
willing, and Christ is willing, and has done his part, and the
Spirit is ready to do his; and shall we be unwilling, and thereby
destroy ourselves? Christ has purchased salvation for us:
the Spirit offers his assistances to us; and shall we refuse these
overtures? Christ invites us to come to him, and leaves it to
our free-will, whether we will comply with, or reject these invitations:
he is, at it were, indeterminate, whether he shall save
us or no, and leaves the matter to our own conduct; we ought
therefore to be persuaded to comply with the invitation. This
method of explaining offers of grace, and invitations, to come
to Christ, is not what we intend when we make use of these
expressions.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider the persons to whom this common
call is given. It is indefinite, not directed only to the elect,
or those, with respect to whom God designs to make it effectual
to their salvation; for, according to the commission which
our Saviour gave to his apostles, the gospel was to be preached
to all nations, or to every creature in those places to which
it was sent: and the reason of this is obvious; namely, because
the counsel of God, concerning election, is secret, and not to
be considered as the rule of human conduct; nor are they,
whom God is pleased to employ in preaching the gospel, supposed
to know whether he will succeed their endeavours, by
enabling those who are called, to comply with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We shall now shew how far the gospel-call may, without
the superadded assistance of special grace, be improved by
men, in order to their attaining some advantage by it, though
short of salvation: this may be done in two respects.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Gross enormous crimes may hereby be avoided: this
appears in many unconverted persons, who not only avoid, but
abhor them; being induced hereunto by something in nature
that gives an aversion to them. And it may be farther argued,
from the liableness of those who commit them, to punishment
in proportion to their respective aggravations; which must
either suppose in man, a power to avoid them: or else, the
greatest degree of punishment would be the result of a necessity
of nature, and not self-procured by any act of man’s will;
though all suppose the will to be free, with respect to actions
that are sinful. It would be a very poor excuse for the murderer
to allege, that he could not govern his passion, but was
under an unavoidable necessity to take away the life of another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Shall the man that commits those sins, which are contrary
to nature, say, That his natural temper and disposition is so
much inclined thereunto, that he could, by no means, avoid
them? If our natural constitution be so depraved and vitiated,
that it leads us, with an uncommon and impetuous violence, to
those sins that we were not formerly inclined to: whence does
this arise, but from the habits of vice, being increased by a wilful
and obstinate continuance therein, and many repeated acts
which they have produced? and might not this, at least, in
some degree, have been avoided? We must distinguish between
habits of sin, that immediately flow from the universal
corruption of nature, and those that have taken deeper root in
us, by being indulged, and exerting themselves, without any
endeavours used, to restrain and give a check to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And if it be supposed that our natures are more habitually
inclined to sin than once they were, might we not so far use
the liberty of our wills, as to avoid some things, which, we are
sensible, will prove a temptation to those particular acts thereof;
whereby the corruption of nature, that is so prone to comply
with it, might be in some measure, restrained, though not
overcome: this may be done without converting grace; and
consequently some great sins may be avoided. To deny this,
would be not only to palliate, but open a door to all manner of
licentiousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Man has a power to do some things that are materially
good; though not good in all those circumstances in which actions
are good that accompany or flow from regenerating grace.
Ahab’s humility, 1 Kings xxi. 29. and Nineveh’s repentance,
Jonah iii. 5. and seq. arose from the dread they had of the divine
threatenings; which is such an inducement to repentance
and reformation, as takes its rise from nothing more than the
influence of common grace. Herod himself, though a vile person,
<i>feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy:
and when he heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly</i>,
Mark vi. 20. And the Gentiles are said to <i>do by nature, the
things</i>; that is, some things <i>contained in the law</i>; insomuch
that <i>they are a law unto themselves</i>, Rom. ii. 14. Therefore
they did them by the influence of common grace. And these
things, namely, abstaining from grosser sins, and doing some
actions materially good, have certainly some advantage attending
them; as thereby the world is not so much like hell as it
would otherwise be: and as to what respects themselves, a
greater degree of punishment is hereby avoided.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are now to consider the design of God in giving this
common call in the gospel, which cannot be the salvation of all
who are thus called: this is evident; because all shall not be
saved; whereas, if God had designed their salvation, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>certainly have brought it about; since his purpose cannot be
frustrated. To say that God has no determinations relating to
the success of the gospel, reflects on his wisdom: and to conclude
that things may happen contrary to his purpose, argues
a defect of power; as though he could not attain the ends he
designed: but this having before been insisted on, under the
heads of election and special redemption, I shall pass it by at
present, and only consider, that the ends which God designed
in giving the gospel, were such as were attained by it, namely,
the salvation of those who shall eventually be saved, the restraining
of those who have only common grace, and the setting
forth the glorious work of redemption by Jesus Christ; which,
as it is the wonder of angels, who desire to look into it; so it
is hereby designed to be recommended as worthy of the highest
esteem, even in those who cast contempt on it: and hereby
they are convicted, who shut their eyes against, and neglect
to behold that glorious light which shines so brightly therein.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> To this it is objected, that if Christ invites and calls
men to come to him, as he often does in the New Testament;
and when they refuse to do it, mentions their refusal with a
kind of regret; as when he says, <i>Ye will not come to me, that
ye might have life</i>, John v. 40. this, they suppose, is no other
than an insult on mankind, a bidding them come without the
least design that they should; as if a magistrate should go to
the prison door, and tell the unhappy man, who is not only under
lock and key, but loaded with irons, that he would have
him leave that place of misery and confinement, and how much
he should rejoice, if he would come out; and upon that condition,
propose to him several honours that he has in reserve for
him: this, say they, is not to deal seriously with him. And if
the offer of grace in the gospel, answers the similitude, as they
suppose it exactly does, then there is no need for any thing
farther to be replied to it; the doctrine confutes itself; as it
argues the divine dealings with men illusory.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> This similitude, how plausible soever it may appear
to be to some, is far from giving a just representation of the
doctrine we are maintaining: for when the magistrate is supposed
to signify his desire that the prisoner would set himself
free, which he knows he cannot do; hereby it is intimated, that
though God knows that the sinner cannot convert himself, yet
he commands him to do it, or to put forth supernatural acts of
grace, though he has no principle of grace in him: but let it
be considered, that this God no where commands any to do.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Our Saviour intends as much as this, when he speaks of the
<i>tree’s being made good</i>, before the fruit it produces can be so,
Matt. xii. 33. or that it is impossible for <i>men to gather grapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of thorns, or figs of thistles</i>, chap. vii. 17. implying, that there
must be an internal disposition wrought, before any acts of
grace can he put forth: this is supposed in the preaching of
the gospel, or the call to sinners to repent and believe, which
they have no reason to conclude that they can do without the
aids of divine grace, and these they are to wait, pray and hope
for, in all God’s instituted methods.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as for those promises which are made to us, if
we would release ourselves from the chains of sin, and the account
given, how much God would rejoice in our being set
free, when the thing is, in itself, impossible; this is no otherwise
true than as it contains a declaration of the connexion
there is between conversion and salvation, or freedom from the
slavery of sin, and God’s conferring many spiritual honours and
privileges on those who are converted; not that it does, in the
least, denote that it is in our own power to convert ourselves:
but that this may be more clearly understood, we shall consider
it with relation to the two branches before mentioned, and
so speak of God, either as commanding, calling, and inviting
men to do what is out of their power, namely, to repent, and
believe; or else, as holding forth promises of that salvation
which they shall not attain; because these graces are out of
their power, which contains the substance of what is usually
objected against the doctrine we are maintaining, by those who
are on the other side of the question; who suppose that this
method of procedure is illusory, and therefore unbecoming the
divine perfections. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning God’s commanding, calling, and inviting men
to do what is out of their own power; as for instance, bidding
a dead man to arise, or one that is blind to see, or those that
are shut up in prison, to come out from thence. This is to be
explained, and then, perhaps, the doctrine we are maintaining,
will appear to be less exceptionable. We have, elsewhere, in
defending the head of particular redemption, against an objection
not much unlike to this, considered how Christ is said to
be offered in the gospel,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> or in what sense the overture may
be said to be made to all that are favoured with it; and yet the
efficacy thereof, only extend to those whom Christ has redeemed,
and shall be effectually called. But that we may a little
farther explain this matter, let us consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That the gospel contains a declaration, that God designs
to save a part of this miserable world; and, that in subserviency
thereunto, he has given them a discovery of Christ, as
the object of faith, and the purchaser and author of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) He does not therein give the least intimation to any,
while in a state of unregeneracy, that they shall be enabled to
believe: and, as the consequence thereof, be saved. Their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>names, characters, or places of abode, or their natural embellishments,
who shall attain this privilege, are no where pointed
at in scripture; nor is the book of God’s secret purpose, concerning
election to eternal life, opened, so as that any one can
discern his name written in it, before he be effectually called;
for we have no warrant to look any farther than God’s revealed
will, which assigns no evidence of our interest in the saving
blessings of the gospel, till they are experienced by us, in this
effectual call.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) God plainly discovers to men, in the gospel, that all
those graces, which are inseparably connected with salvation,
are his work and gift, and consequently out of their own power;
or that <i>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that sheweth mercy</i>, Rom. ix. 16. Therefore he
no where tells the man, who <i>is tied and bound with the chain
of his sin</i>, that he is able to set himself free; but puts him upon
expecting and praying for it, from the <i>pitifulness of his great
mercy</i>. He no where tells him, that he can implant a principle
of spiritual life and grace in himself; or that he ought so much
as to attempt to do any thing to atone for his sins, by his obedience
and sufferings, but suggests the contrary, when he says,
<i>Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and
strength</i>, Isa. xlv. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) He gives none the least ground to expect, or lay claim
to salvation, till they believe; and as faith and salvation are
both his gifts, he puts them upon seeking, and desiring them,
in their respective order; first grace, and then glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) The gospel-call is designed to put men upon a diligent
attendance on the ordinances, as means of grace, and to leave
the issue and success thereof to God, who <i>waits that he may
be gracious</i>; that so his sovereignty may appear more eminently
in the dispensing this privilege; and, in the mean time, assigns
it as their duty to <i>wait for him</i>, chap. xxx. 18. And
while we are engaged in this duty, we are to acknowledge, that
we have nothing that can give us any right to this privilege.
So that God might justly deny success to his ordinances. Nevertheless,
if he is pleased to give us, while we are attending
on them, those earnest desires of their being made effectual to
our conversion and salvation, we may conclude this to be a token
for good, that he designs us some special advantage thereby;
and we do not know but that even this desire of grace may
be the beginning of the Spirit’s saving work, and therefore an
earnest of his carrying it on.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) When God commands persons, in the gospel, to do
those things which cannot be performed without his special
grace, he sometimes supposes them, when he gives forth the
command, to have a principle of spiritual life and grace, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>is, in effect to bid one that is made alive, to put forth living actions;
which respect, more especially, the progress of grace after
the work is begun; in which sense I understand those
words of the apostle, <i>Work out your salvation with fear and
trembling; for it is God which worketh; that is, hath wrought,
in you both to will and to do, of his good pleasure</i>, Phil. ii. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If we consider the gospel as holding forth promises of
salvation, when, at the same time, it is not in our power to exercise
those graces that accompany it; which gives farther occasion
to those that except against the doctrine we are maintaining,
to conclude, that it represents God as offering those
blessings which he does not design to bestow: This may give
us occasion to explain what we mean, when we consider salvation
as offered in the gospel; whereby we understand nothing
else but a declaration, that all who repent and believe, shall be
saved; which contains a character, or description of the persons
who have ground to expect this privilege: not that salvation
is founded on dubious and uncertain conditions, which depend
upon the power and liberty of our will; or impossible
conditions; as though God should say, if man will change his
own heart, and work faith, and all other graces in himself, then
he will save him: but all that we mean by it is, that those graces,
which are inseparably connected with salvation, are to be
waited for in our attendance on all God’s ordinances, and when
he is pleased to work them, then we may conclude, that we
have a right to the promise of salvation. Thus concerning the
gospel-call, what it is, how far it may be improved by those
who are destitute of special grace, and what is God’s design in
giving it: we now proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The issue and consequence thereof, as it is farther observed
in this answer, that many wilfully neglect, contemn, or refuse
to comply with it, with respect to whom it is not made effectual
to their salvation. This appears from the report that
Christ’s disciples brought to him, concerning the excuses that
many made when called to come to the marriage feast, in the
parable: One pretended, that he had <i>bought a piece of ground,
and must needs go see it</i>; and another, that he had <i>bought five
yoke of oxen, and</i> must <i>go to prove them</i>; and another <i>had married
a wife, and</i> therefore <i>could not come</i>. It is elsewhere said,
that <i>they all made light of it, and went their ways; one to his
farm, another to his merchandise; and the remnant took his servants,
and entreated them spitefully, and slew them</i>, Luke xiv.
18-20. compared with Matt. xxii. 5, 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the prophet introduces our Saviour himself as complaining,
<i>I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for
nought</i>, Isa. xlix. 4, 5. And the reason hereof is, because Israel
is <i>not gathered</i>; which words are to be understood in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>comparative sense, as denoting the fewness of those who complied
with his gracious invitations, to come to him, or were
convinced, by the miracles which he wrought to confirm his
doctrine.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is also farther evident, from the small number of those
who are effectually prevailed upon under the gospel dispensation,
which the apostle calls <i>the grace of God that brings salvation,
that hath appeared to all men, teaching them to deny all
ungodliness and worldly lusts; and to live soberly, righteously,
and godly, in this present world</i>. And also, from the great opposition
and hatred, which many express to the person of Christ,
who is the subject matter thereof; which the prophet not only
relates, as what was observed in his day, but foretells, that in
after-ages, a great part of mankind would not believe the report
made concerning him; but that he should be <i>despised and rejected
of men</i>, who would <i>hide</i>, as it were, <i>their faces from him</i>,
and <i>not esteem him</i>, Isa. liii. 1, 3. This is certainly the highest
contempt of the gospel; for it is an undervaluing the greatest
privileges, as though they were not worthy to be embraced,
desired, or sought after; and inasmuch as this is wilful, arising
from the enmity of the will of man against God, and the method
of salvation which he has prescribed therein, it has a tendency
to provoke his wrath; so that being justly left in their
unbelief, they will not come to Christ, that they may have life.
And as they are judicially left to themselves, they contract a
greater degree of alienation from, and averseness to God, and
so never truly come to Jesus Christ; which is an awful and
tremendous consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the consequence of it, with respect to those who have
only this common call; and therefore we must not conclude,
that it is sufficient to salvation, unless there be an internal effectual
call; and what this is, will be considered under our next
head; but before we enter thereon, it is necessary for us to enquire,
whether all, at least, those who sit under the sound of
the gospel, have sufficient grace given them, so as that, by their
own conduct, without the internal powerful influences of the
Spirit, they may attain to salvation. This argument is much
insisted on by those who adhere to the Pelagian scheme; and
therefore we cannot wholly pass it over: and for our setting
this matter in a just light, let it be considered; that every one
must allow, that all who sit under the sound of the gospel, have
sufficient objective grace, or sufficient external means, to lead
them in the way of salvation; for to deny this, would be to deny
that the gospel is a perfect rule of faith: this therefore is allowed
on both sides; and we think nothing more is intended,
when God says, concerning the church of the Jews, <i>What
could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done
in it</i>, Isa. v. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>But the question is, whether there be a sufficiency of power,
or ability in man; so that without the internal efficacious grace
of God, determining and inclining the will, to make a right improvement
of it, it may be sufficient to the salvation of those
to whom it is given? This is what we cannot but deny. Now,
that the external means of grace are not rendered effectual to
the salvation of all who are favoured with them, is evident; because,
as was but now observed, many neglect and contemn the
gospel: and as to others who improve it, so that the means of
grace become effectual, it must be enquired; what it is that
makes them so? How comes it to pass, that the preaching
thereof is styled, to some, a savour of life, to others, a savour
of death? The answer which the Pelagians give to this, is,
that they, in whom it is effectual, render it so, by their improving
the liberty of their will; so that they choose what is
represented in the gospel, as eligible, and refuse the contrary.
And if the question be asked, who maketh thee to differ from
another? they have, when disposed to speak agreeably to their
own scheme, this answer ready at hand, I make myself to differ;
that is as much as to say, I have a natural power of improving
the means of grace, without having recourse to God
for any farther assistance, in a supernatural way.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may easily be observed, that this supposition is greatly
derogatory to the glory of God; and renders all dependance
on him, both to will and to do, unnecessary: It supposes that
we have sufficient ability to work those graces in ourselves that
accompany salvation; otherwise it is not sufficient to salvation;
and therefore it is contrary to all those scriptures which speak
of them as the work, or the effect of the exceeding greatness
of the power of God: which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, The doctrine of effectual calling, as contained in
the former of the answers, which we are explaining; in which
we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The character of those who are effectually called antecedent
thereunto. They have nothing that can recommend them
to the divine favour; for being considered as fallen, guilty
creatures, they are not only unable to make atonement for sin,
but to do what is spiritually good: thus the apostle represents
them, <i>as without strength</i>, Rom. v. 6. which is the immediate
consequence of man’s first apostacy from God; and universal
experience, proves that we have a propensity to every thing
that is evil, which daily increases: And to this we may add,
that the mind is blinded, the affections stupified, the will full
of obstinacy, the conscience disposed to deal treacherously,
whereby we deceive ourselves; so that the whole soul is out
of order. The apostle speaks of man <i>by nature</i>, as <i>dead in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>trespasses and sins, walking according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that
now worketh in the children of disobedience; having their conversation
in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh,
and of the mind</i>, Eph. ii. 1-3. And the prophet speaks of
the <i>heart</i> of man, as being <i>deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked</i>, Jer. xvii. 9. And the apostle describes some
as ‘walking in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding
darkened, being alienated from the life of God,
through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness
of their heart; who being past feeling, have given themselves
over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with
greediness,’ Eph. iv. 17-19. and others, as being ‘filled with
all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without
understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful,’ Rom. i. 29-31. This, indeed, is
spoken of the Gentiles, who were destitute of the means of
grace, and had contracted greater degrees of impiety than many
others; but they, who are effectually called, would have run
into the same abominations, their natures being equally inclined
thereunto, without preventing grace; as some of the church
of Corinth are said to have done before their conversion, whom
he speaks of as once having been ‘unrighteous, fornicators,
idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with
mankind, thieves; covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners,’
1 Cor. vi. 9, 10, 11. And elsewhere he says, ‘We ourselves
also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
and hating one another,’ Tit. iii. 3. And the obstinacy and
perverseness of men, going on in a course of sin, is so great,
that God reproves a professing people, by telling them, that
<i>their neck was as an iron sinew, and their brow brass</i>, Isa.
xlviii. 4. Thus they were, before he <i>refined</i> and <i>chose</i> some
of <i>them, in the furnace of affliction</i>, ver. 10. From hence it
evidently appears, that men are not naturally inclined to comply
with the gospel-call; but this is a privilege conferred on
them, when, by the Spirit, it is made effectual to their salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> It is objected, to what has been said concerning persons
being dead in sin, before they are effectually called; that
that is no other than a metaphorical expression; and therefore
the sense thereof is not to be strained so far as to suppose from
hence, that they are altogether without a power to do that which
is spiritually good.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><i>Answ.</i> When the state of men, before they are effectually
called, is styled, a death in sin, which is a metaphorical expression,
we must suppose, that there is a sense affixed to it,
which, in some respects, is adapted to those ideas that we have
of the word. If scripture-metaphors prove nothing, because
the words are transferred from their literal sense to some other
that is intended thereby, we shall be at the greatest loss to understand
many important doctrines contained in the sacred
writings, which abound very much with such modes of speaking.
We do not suppose the metaphor to be extended so far,
as that a person, dead in sin, is incapable of acting, as though
he was a stock or a stone, the contrary to which is evident,
from what has been before said concerning the power which
they, who are in an unregenerate state, have of doing things
materially good; but we are now considering men as unable to
do what is good in all its circumstances, which may render
their actions the object of the divine approbation, as agreeable
to God’s revealed will; and this, we suppose, an unregenerate
person is as unable to do, as a dead man is to put forth living
actions; and the reason is, because he is destitute of a supernatural
principle of spiritual life. Scripture and experience,
not only evince the weakness, blindness, and disinclination of
such, to what is good, but their averseness to it: So that whatever
we do, either in the beginning or progress of the life of
faith, must proceed from a renewed nature, or a supernatural
principle implanted in the soul; which is sometimes called, a
<i>new heart</i>, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. a <i>divine nature</i>, 2 Pet. i. 4. as
well as a quickening, or being raised from the dead. This
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The change that is wrought in this effectual calling, together
with the grounds we have to conclude, that it is a supernatural
work, or, as it is styled in this answer, the work of
God’s almighty power and grace. Those whom we more especially
oppose in this head of argument, are the Pelagians,
and others; who, though in some things they seem to recede
from them, yet cannot support their cause without giving into
their scheme, when treating on the subjects of free-will, nature
and grace: these all allow that there is a change made in conversion
or effectual calling; but they suppose that it is a change
in man’s natural temper and disposition, rather than what arises
from a supernatural principle, which, according to them, consists
in overcoming those habits of sin, which we have contracted,
and acquiring habits of virtue, a ceasing to do evil,
and learning to do well; and that it is in their own power supposing
the concurrence of God as a God of nature, or at least,
some superadded assistances, from the external dispensations
of providence, which have an influence on the minds of men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to produce this change; by this means they think that grace is
first attained, and we disposed to comply with the external call
of the gospel, whereby it is rendered effectual.</p>

<p class='c006'>They sometimes indeed, use the word conversion, and speak
of the power and grace of God herein; and that they may not
seem to detract from the glory thereof, they profess themselves
to adore and magnify God as the author of this work; but all
this amounts to no more than nature acting under the influence
of common providence. Something, indeed, they ascribe to
God; but much less than what we think the scripture does.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which they ascribe to him therein, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That he has made man an intelligent creature, having a
power capable of choosing whatever seems advantageous, or
refusing what appears to be destructive to him; and in order
hereunto, he is able to discern, what is his duty and interest;
and when the will duly attends to these dictates of the understanding,
it has a power inclining it to be influenced thereby,
and embrace whatever overtures are made conducive to his
future happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Whereas the understanding and reasoning powers and
faculties, are oftentimes impaired and hindered, in their method
of acting, by some accidental inconveniences of nature, such as
the temperament of the body, or those diseases which it is
sometimes liable to, which affect the mind; these God, by his
powerful providence, removes, or fences against, that the work
may go on successfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Sometimes our outward circumstances in the world, give
a different turn to our passions, and hinder us from entertaining
any inclinations to religion; therefore, they suppose, that
there is a farther hand of providence in ordering the various
changes or conditions of life, as to what concerns the prosperous
or adverse circumstances thereof, whereby a sanguine temper
is changed to that which has more of a melancholy or
thoughtful disposition in it, more inclined to be afraid of those
sins that are like to be prejudicial to him; an angry and choleric
temper, changed to another that has a greater mixture of
meekness and humility; and whatever hinderance may arise
from his conversing with those who tempt him to lay aside all
thoughts about religion, or by loading it with reproach, to
make him ashamed to pretend to it, the providence of God so
orders circumstances and things, as to make them unacceptable
to him, or him disinclined to converse with them: by this
means there arises a congruity, as they call it, between men’s
natural dispositions and that grace which they are called, by
the gospel, to exert, when they are persuaded to comply with
it, without which the overture would be in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Providence farther performs its part, by over-ruling some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>concurring circumstances external to, and thought of, by him,
in casting his lot among those who are able and desirous to
persuade him to alter his sentiments, in matters of religion
whose industry and zeal for his good, accompanied with their
skilfulness in managing those persuasive arguments used to
convince him, have a great tendency to prevail upon him;
hereby he is persuaded to give the hearing to that which before
he despised, and made the subject of ridicule; and sometimes
the motives and inducements that are used, accompanied
with the pathetic way of address, in those whose ministry he
attends on, is very conducive to answer the end attained thereby,
namely, his conviction and altering his conduct of life, pursuant
thereunto; all which is under the unforeseen direction
of providence.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. They add, that there is a kind of internal work in exciting
the passions, by a general influence upon them, leaving it,
notwithstanding, in man’s power to determine them, with respect
to their proper objects; and as for the will, that still remains
free and unbiassed; but by this moral suasion, or these
rational arguments, it is prevailed upon to comply with that
which is for its advantage. According to this method of accounting
for the work of conversion, what they attribute to the
grace of God, is nothing more than what is the result of common
providence; and it is supposed to act no otherwise than
in an objective way; and that which gives the turn to all is,
the influence of moral suasion, whereby men are prevailed on;
but in all these respects, they are only beholden to God, as the
God of nature: and when this is called, by them, a display of
divine grace, nature and grace, in this matter, are made to signify
the same thing, without scripture warrant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, since, it is plain, all this may be done, and yet
persons remain in an unconverted state, and the gospel-call be
ineffectual, they suppose there is something to be performed on
man’s part, which gives a sanction to, and completes the work:
accordingly he must rightly use and improve the power of reasoning,
which God has given him, by diligently observing and
attending to his law; and he must persuade himself, that it is
highly reasonable to obey it; and must also duly weigh the
consequence of his compliance or refusal, and endeavour to
affect himself with the consideration of promised rewards and
punishments, to excite his diligence, or awaken his fears; and
must make use of those motives that are proper to induce him
to lead a virtuous life; and when he is brought to conclude
this most eligible, then he must add hereunto, the force of the
strongest resolutions, to avoid occasions of sin, perform several
necessary duties, and associate himself with those whose conversation
and example may induce him to be virtuous; he must attend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>on the word preached, with intenseness of thought, and a
disposition to adhere, with the greatest impartiality, to what is
recommended to him therein, as conducive to his future happiness:
by this means he is persuaded; and from thence proceed
those acts of grace, which afterwards, by being frequently
repeated, arrive to a habit, which, if it be not lost by negligence,
stupidity, and impenitency, or adhering to the temptations
of Satan, being brought into a state of conversion, he is
in a fair way to heaven, which, notwithstanding this, he may
of by apostasy, since the work is to be carried on by him, as it
was at first begun, by his own conduct.</p>

<p class='c006'>This account of effectual calling or conversion, supposes it
to be little more than a work of common providence; and all
the grace they seem to own, is nothing more than nature exerting
itself under the conduct of those reasoning powers which
God has given it. None pretend to deny that our reasoning
powers are herein to be exerted and improved; or that those
arguments, which tend to give conviction, and motives to enforce
obedience, must be duly attended to: neither do we deny
that there is a kind hand of providence seen in over-ruling our
natural tempers and dispositions, in giving a check to that corruption
that is prevalent in us; and in rendering our condition
of life, some way or other conducive to a farther work, which
God designs to bring about. We also assert, that providence
greatly favours us in bringing us under the means of grace,
or casting our lot in such places where we have the advantages
of the conversation and example of others, who are burning
and shining lights in their generation; nor is it less seen in
adapting a suitable word to our condition, or in raising our
affections, while attending to it: but all this falls very short of
effectual calling, as it is a display of God’s power and grace.
This work is no more than natural; whereas conversion is a
supernatural work. Hitherto we may be led by common grace;
but effectual calling is a work of special grace; the effect of
this is only a change of life: but we assert, and have scripture
ground for it, that there is in that a change of heart. This
scheme supposes the very principle and spring of grace to be
acquired by man’s improving his natural powers, under the
conduct of God’s providence: whereas, we suppose, and shall
endeavour to prove, under a following head, that it is not acquired,
but infused, and is the effect of divine power. This
supposes the work to be brought about by moral suasion; and
that the understanding, taking in the arguments that are made
use of in an objective way, the will is induced to compliance,
by choosing that which is good, and refusing that which is
evil: whereas, we assert, that the will of man is bowed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>subjected to Christ, its enmity overcome; and accordingly we
are said to be made willing in the day of his power.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since that which bears the greatest share in this work,
according to them, is the will and power of man, determining
itself, by proper motives and arguments, to what is good;
which supposes, that it acts freely therein. This may give us
occasion to consider the nature of human liberty; we do not
deny, in general, that man is endowed with a free will, which
exerts itself in things of a lower nature, to that which we are
speaking of, for this is as evident, as that he is endowed with
an understanding: we shall therefore, in speaking concerning
the liberty of the will of man, (1.) Consider what are the essential
properties of liberty,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> without which, an action would
cease to be free. And, (2.) How far the power of man’s free-will
may be extended, with a particular view to the matter,
under our present consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning the nature and essential properties of human
liberty. They, whose sentiments of free-will and grace we are
opposing, suppose that it is essential to a free action, or otherwise
it could not be denominated free, that it be performed
with indifferency, that is, that the will of man should be so
equally poised, that as it determines itself to one extreme, it
might as well have determined itself to the other: therefore,
he that loves God freely, might, by a determination of his
will, as well have inclined himself to hate him; and on the
other hand, he that hates God, might, by an act of his will,
have determined himself to love him: the balance is supposed
to be equal, and it is the method that the person uses to determine
his will, that gives a turn to it. And from hence they
infer, that they who persevere in grace, which they do freely,
may, for the same reason, apostatize; yea, they proceed farther,
at least some of them, who have maintained, that our Saviour
might have sinned, and consequently the work of our
redemption have miscarried in his hands; because, according
to this notion of liberty, he acted freely in all those exercises
of grace; which, we suppose, were no less free, because they
were necessary; and also, from this account they give of liberty,
they infer that the angels and glorified saints might sin, and
so lose that state of blessedness, which they are possessed of;
otherwise their obedience is not free; which absurdities are so
apparently gross, that they who duly weigh them, will not easily
give into this notion of liberty. And there is another absurdity,
which the Pelagians dare not assert; for it would be
the greatest blasphemy that could be contained in words, though
it equally flows from this method of explaining the nature of
liberty; that either God must not act freely, or else he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>act the contrary, with respect to those things in which he acts,
like himself, as a God of infinite perfection; and accordingly,
if he loves or delights in himself freely, or designs his own
glory, as the highest end of all that he does, and uses means
to bring about those ends which are most conducive thereunto;
wherein his holiness, wisdom, justice, and faithfulness
appear, I say, it will follow from their scheme, and I cannot
but tremble to mention it, that he might do the contrary; and
what is this but to say, that he might cease to be God.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arguments which they who attempt to support this notion
of liberty, insist on, are taken from the ideas which we
generally have of a person’s acting freely; as for instance, if
a man performs any of the common actions of life, such as
walking, sitting, standing, reading, writing, &amp;c. freely, he may
do the contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this I answer, That there is a vast difference between
asserting, that many of the actions of life are arbitrary or indifferent,
so that we might do the contrary; and saying that indifferency
is essential to liberty; for that which is essential to
an action must belong to every individual action of the same
kind.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Thus concerning their notion of liberty, whom we oppose.</p>

<p class='c006'>But on the other hand, that which we acquiesce in, is, that
its essential property or nature, consists in a person’s doing a
thing without being laid under a natural necessity to do it;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
or doing it of his own accord, without any force laid on him.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Others express it by a person’s doing a thing out of choice, as
having the highest reason to determine him so to do.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> This is
that notion of liberty which we cannot but approve of; and we
are now to shew,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) How far the power of man’s free-will may be extended,
with a particular view to the matter under our present consideration.
Here let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That the power of man’s will extends itself to things,
within its own sphere, and not above it; all actions and powers
of acting, are contained within certain limits, agreeable to
the nature and capacity of the agent. Creatures below man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>cannot put forth rational actions: and man cannot put forth
supernatural actions, if he be not made partaker of a divine or
spiritual nature, as being endowed with a supernatural principle,
such as that which is implanted in regeneration. Consider
him as an intelligent creature, and it is agreeable to his nature
to put forth free actions, under the conduct and direction of
the understanding; but if we consider him as renewed, converted,
or effectually called, and acting agreeably thereunto,
then he is under the influence of an higher principle, which I
call a <i>divine nature</i>, according to the phrase which the apostle
uses, 2 Pet. i. 4. The former of these supposes no more than
the concourse of common providence, which at first gave, and
then maintains our reasoning faculties; whereas the latter supposes,
that we are under the influence of the Spirit; whereby
we are enabled to act in a supernatural way, our natures being
renewed and disposed thereunto, in which we are not divested
of the liberty of our wills; but they are improved and enabled,
to do what before they were averse and disinclined to.</p>

<p class='c006'>That man acts freely in those things which are agreeable to
his nature, as an intelligent creature, all will allow. Moreover,
we consider the understanding and will, as both concurring in
actions that are free, and that one of these is subservient to the
other; as for instance, we cannot be said to desire, delight in,
choose, or refuse a thing unless we have some idea of it, as an
object, which we apprehend meet to be desired or rejected.</p>

<p class='c006'>And if it be farther enquired, Whether the will has, in itself,
a power to follow the dictates of the understanding, in things
that are agreeable to our nature, and be generally disposed to
do it, unless biassed by the passions, inclining and determining
it another way? This, I think, is not to be denied; but in our
present argument, we are to consider the will of man as conversant
about things supernatural, and accordingly, must give
a different account of Christian liberty, from that which is
merely human, as before described. The Pelagians will allow
what has been said concerning the nature of liberty in general;
but the difference between us and them is, that we confine it
within its own sphere; whereas they extend it farther, and apply
it to regeneration, effectual calling, and conversion; in
which respect it discovers itself no otherwise than as enslaved
to, or a servant of sin;<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and the powers and faculties of the
soul, with relation hereunto, are weakened by the prevalency
of corruption, so that we are not able to put forth those actions
which proceed from, and determine a person to be <i>renewed in
the spirit of his mind</i>; or to have <i>put on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, if it be farther enquired; whether the will necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>follows the dictates of the understanding, so that the grace
of God takes its first rise from thence? that which I would
say in answer thereunto is, That the understanding, indeed, represents
things spiritual and heavenly to us, as good and desirable,
and worthy of all acceptation; and gives us an undeniable
conviction, that all the motives used in scripture, to
choose and embrace them, are highly probable; but yet it does
not follow from hence, that the will of man is always overcome
thereby;<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the reason is, because of that strong propensity
and inclination that there is in corrupt nature to sin,
which bids defiance to all those arguments and persuasions that
are used to the contrary, till we are brought under the influence
of a supernatural principle, implanted in the soul in effectual
calling.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us farther to enquire: Whether, supposing a
man has this principle implanted in effectual calling, he then
acts freely; or, what is the liberty of man’s will, when internally
moved and influenced by divine grace? In answer to which,
we must consider, that special grace does not destroy, but improve
the liberty of man’s will: when there is a new nature implanted
in him, it discovers its energy, and makes a change in
all the powers and faculties of the soul; there is a new light
shining in the understanding, vastly different from, and superior
to that which it had before; and it may truly be called,
<i>The light of life</i>, John viii. 12. not only as it leads to eternal
life; but as it proceeds from a principle of spiritual life: and
this is what we generally call <i>saving knowledge</i>; as it is said,
<i>This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent</i>, chap. xvii. 13.
Now this light in the understanding, being attended with power
in the will, it is hereby induced to comply with its dictates, not
barely as being prevailed on by rational arguments, but as there
is a divine power accompanying them; it is not indeed prevailed
on without arguments; for the Spirit makes use of the word
to persuade, as well as to direct; though we do not, with the
Pelagians, say, that the will is overcome only by arguments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>as though the victory was owing to our power of reasoning;
yet we freely own, that we act with judgment, and see the
highest reason for what we do: we are enabled to use our reasoning
powers indeed; but these are sanctified by the Spirit,
as well as the will renewed; and both concur together, in order
to our receiving and improving the doctrines contained in
the gospel; and the Spirit of God also removes those rooted
prejudices which we had entertained against the way of salvation
by Christ: so that upon the whole, the gospel has its use,
as it directs and excites our faith: our reasoning powers and
faculties have their use also, as we take in, and are convinced,
by what is therein contained; all this would be to no purpose,
if there were not a superior power determining the will to a
thorough compliance therewith. We do not deny that moral
suasion oftentimes has a tendency to incline a man to the performance
of moral duties; but it is what I rather choose to call
evangelical persuasion, or the Spirit of God setting home upon
the heart and conscience, what is contained in the gospel, that
makes it effectual to salvation.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Thus concerning the nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and extent of human liberty; but inasmuch as this is not
to be assigned as that which renders the gospel-call effectual,
let it be farther considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. That this is brought about by the almighty power of
God, as it is observed in this answer, that it is a work of God’s
almighty power and grace: this is that which enhances the excellency
and glory of it, above all the works of common providence:
however, when we say that it is a divine work, this is
hardly sufficient to distinguish it from what the Pelagians often
call it, by which they intend nothing more, than the powerful
work of God, as the God of nature and providence; therefore
we must farther consider it as a work of divine power, exerting
itself in a supernatural way and not only excluding the
agency of creatures, as bearing a part therein, but as opposed
to those works which are brought about by the moral influence
of persuasive arguments, without any change wrought in
the will of man; in this sense we understand effectual calling
to be a work of God’s almighty power.</p>

<p class='c006'>And that this may appear, let it be premised, that it is not
inconsistent with God’s dealing with men as intelligent creatures,
endowed with liberty of will, for him to exert this power,
since special providence, or efficacious grace, does no more destroy
man’s natural powers, by its internal influence, enabling
and exciting them to do what is supernaturally good, than common
providence’s being conversant about the free actions of
men, makes them cease to be free; only the former exerts itself
in a different and superior way, producing effects much
more glorious and excellent.</p>

<p class='c006'>This being supposed, we shall, without pretending fully to
explain the manner of the divine agency, which is principally
known by its effects, endeavour to shew,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That effectual calling is, in a way of eminency, the work
of divine power as distinguished from other works, which are,
in their kind, the effects of power in a natural way.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall also observe what effects are produced thereby,
and in what order.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Consider it, as it is, in a peculiar manner, attributed to
the Spirit of God; and also shew, that it is a wonderful instance
of his grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>4. We shall consider this divine power as irresistible, and
consequently such as cannot but be effectual to produce what
is designed to be brought about thereby. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Speak something concerning the season in which this is
done, which is called God’s accepted time.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Effectual calling is eminently a work of divine power; for
the proof hereof, we have not only many express texts of scripture
that sufficiently establish it, but we may appeal to the experience
of those who are made partakers of this grace. If they
compare their former and present state together, they may easily
perceive in themselves, that there is such a change wrought
in them, as is contrary to the inclinations of corrupt nature;
whereby the stubbornness and obstinacy of their wills have been
subdued, and such effects produced in them, as they never experienced
before; and the manner of their production, as well
as the consequences thereof, give them a proof of the agency
of God herein, and the glory of his power exerted, so that they
who deny it must be unacquainted with themselves, or not duly
observe that which carries its own evidence with it.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But we shall principally take our proofs from scripture, in
which we have an account of the beginning of this work, which
is styled the new birth; wherein we are said to be made <i>partakers
of the divine nature</i>, 2 Pet. i. 4. that is, a nature that is
produced by divine power; and we are said to be <i>born, not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God</i>, John i. 13. And the gospel, which is the instrument that
he makes use of in calling effectually, is styled, <i>The rod of his
strength</i>, Psal. cx. 2. the effect thereof, ascribed to the <i>revelation
of his arm</i>, Isa. liii. 1. the season in which this is done, is
called, <i>The day of his power</i>, Psal. cx. 3. and it is, by a metonymy,
called, <i>His power</i>, 1 Cor. i. 18. Rom. i. 16. The cross
of Christ is also, when preached, and made effectual for the
answering this valuable end, styled, The <i>power of God</i>, 1 Cor.
i. 24. Moreover, the progress of this work is ascribed to the
<i>power of God</i>, 1 Thess. i. 5. it is this that <i>keeps</i> those who are
effectually called <i>through faith unto salvation</i>, 1 Pet. i. 5. And
that this power may appear to be extraordinary, the apostle
uses an uncommon emphasis of expression, when he calls it,
<i>The exceeding greatness of his power</i>, and, <i>the working of his
mighty power</i>, Eph. i. 19, 20. which words<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> can hardly be
translated without losing something of their force and beauty;
and, indeed, there is not an expression used in scripture, to
signify the efficacy of divine power, that exceeds, or, I may
say, that equals them. And that it may appear more strong,
the apostle, in the following words, represents it as being no
less than <i>that power which wrought in Christ, when God raised
him from the dead</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to all this let me add, that something to the same purpose
may be inferred from those metaphorical expressions, by
which it is set forth, as it is called a <i>creation</i>: thus, when we
are made partakers of this privilege, we are said to <i>be created
in righteousness and true holiness</i>, Eph. iv. 24. And the apostle
seems to compare this with the creation of man at first, after
the image of God, which consisted principally in righteousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and true holiness, and accordingly considers this image as
restored, when a principle of grace is implanted, whereby we
are again disposed to the exercise of righteousness and holiness:
and elsewhere he says, <i>We are his workmanship, created
in Christ Jesus unto good works, that we should walk in them</i>,
chap. ii. 16. where he supposes, that this creating power must
be exerted before we can put forth good works; and therefore
it can be nothing less than the power of God; and it would
not have been styled a <i>creation</i>, if it had not been a supernatural
work, and therefore it is, in that respect, more glorious
than many other effects of the divine power.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also styled, <i>a resurrection from the dead</i>: thus the apostle
says, <i>You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses
and sins</i>, chap. ii. 1, 5. in this respect it certainly exceeds the
power of men. A physician, by his skill, may mend a crazy
constitution, or recover it from the confines of death; but, to
raise the dead, exceeds the limits of finite power. This mode
of speaking our Saviour makes use of to signify the conversion
or effectual call of sinners, when he says, <i>The hour is coming,
and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God; and they that hear shall live</i>, John v. 25. He had, in the
foregoing verse been speaking of their <i>having eternal life</i>, and
<i>not coming into condemnation, and being passed from death to
life</i>, who hear his words and believe; and then it follows, that
<i>the hour is coming</i>, that is, the time is near at hand, to wit,
when the Spirit shall be poured forth, and the gospel-dispensation
be begun, and it <i>now is</i>, in some degree, namely, in those
who were converted by his ministry, <i>when the dead shall hear
his voice and live</i>, or pass from a state of spiritual death to life,
as a means for their attaining eternal life. This is much more
agreeable to the context, than to conclude, as some do, to evade
the force of this argument; that our Saviour speaks concerning
some who were then, or should hereafter be raised from
the dead, in a miraculous manner; which, they suppose, contains
the sense of the words, <i>now is</i>, and that <i>the hour is coming</i>,
refers to the general resurrection; but this seems not to
be the sense of the text; because our Saviour supposes them,
in a following verse, to be astonished at this doctrine; as
though it was too great an instance of power for him to implant
a principle of spiritual life in dead sinners; and therefore he
proves his assertion from his raising the dead at the last day:
<i>Marvel not, for the hour is coming</i>, that is, at the end of the
world, <i>when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice</i>,
John v. 28. This cannot well agree with the sense before given,
of Christ’s raising the dead, as referring to the general resurrection;
for that would be to answer their objection, or put
a stop to their wonder at what he had said concerning it, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>asserting the same thing in other words; whereas, if you suppose
the dead’s <i>hearing his voice</i>, to imply a spiritual resurrection;
and <i>the dead raised out of their graves</i>, to be an argument
to convince them that his power was sufficient to bring
about this great effect; there is much more beauty in the expression,
and strength in the reasoning, than to take it otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is so plain a proof of the argument, we are endeavouring
to defend, that nothing farther need be added: however, I
cannot but mention another scripture, in which our Saviour
says, that <i>no one can come to him, except the Father draw him</i>,
chap. vi. 44. where Christ, by <i>coming to him</i>, does not mean
attending on his ministry, which did not require any power to
induce them to it; but <i>believing on him</i>, so as to <i>have everlasting
life</i>, in which sense, <i>coming to him</i>, is often taken in the
gospels, ver. 47. and this is the immediate consequence of effectual
calling. Now when our Saviour says, that <i>none can</i>
thus <i>come to him</i>, without being <i>drawn by the Father</i>, we may
understand what he means here, by what is said in a following
verse, namely, their being <i>taught of God</i>, and having <i>heard and
learned of the Father</i>, ver. 45. such, says he, <i>Come unto me</i>.
Now this <i>teaching</i> certainly implies more than giving a rule of
faith contained in divine revelation, for Christ is not here proving
the necessity of divine revelation, as elsewhere; but is
speaking concerning the saving efficacy thereof; and none can
deny that many have been objectively taught, and instructed
by the word, who have not come to Christ, or believed in him
to everlasting life: the words are a quotation from the prophets,
to which he refers; who intimate, that they should be <i>all taught
of God</i>; which certainly implies more than an objective teaching
and instructing; for in this sense, they, having divine revelation,
were always taught of God: and it is a special privilege,
which the prophet Isaiah mentions, when he foretels this matter,
as appears by his connecting it with that great peace which
they should have, or the confluence of saving blessings, which
should attend it, Isa. liv. 13. And the prophet Jeremiah, who
speaks to the same purpose, says, <i>They shall teach no more
every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying,
know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the least of
them, even to the greatest</i>, Jer. xxxi. 33, 34. that is, they shall
not only have an objective revelation, or that which some call
moral suasion; but this shall be made effectual to their salvation;
and in order thereunto, God promises that he would
<i>put his law in the inward part, and write it in the heart</i>; and
elsewhere, to <i>give</i> them <i>a new heart</i>, and to <i>put a new spirit
within them</i>, and hereby to <i>cause them to walk in his statutes</i>,
Ezek. xxxvi. 26. So that it is not barely a rectifying some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>mistakes which they were liable to; but producing in them
something, which they had not before; not building upon the
old foundation, but laying a new one, and so working a change
in the powers and faculties of the soul; and as they were before,
obdurate and hardened in sin, he promises to <i>take away
the heart of stone, and give them an heart of flesh</i>; and by his
<i>word</i>, which is compared to an <i>hammer, to break the rock in
pieces</i>, Jer. xxiii. 29. This is certainly a work of power; but
that it is so, will farther appear from what follows, in considering
the work itself; which leads us to shew,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. What effects are produced by the power of God, when
we are thus called.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The first step that he is pleased to take in this work, is
in his implanting a principle of spiritual life and grace, which
is absolutely necessary for our attaining to, or receiving advantage
by the external call of the gospel; this is generally styled
regeneration, or the new birth; or, as in the scripture but now
referred to, a <i>new heart</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be enquired, What we are to understand by this principle?
We answer, that since principles are only known by the
effects which they produce; springs of acting, by the actions
themselves, we must be content with this description; that it
is something wrought in the heart of man, whereby he is habitually
and prevailingly biassed and inclined to what is good:
so that by virtue hereof, he freely, readily, and willingly chooses
those things which tend to the glory of God; and refuses, abhors,
and flees from what is contrary thereunto; and, as this
more immediately affects the understanding, whereby it is enabled
to discern the things which God reveals in the gospel in
a spiritual way, it is styled, his <i>shining in the heart</i>, 2 Cor. iv.
6. <i>to give us the light of the knowledge of his glory</i>, or, his
giving <i>an eye to see, and an ear to hear</i>, Deut. xxix. 4. As it
respects the will, it contains in it a power, whereby it is disposed
and enabled to yield the obedience of faith, to whatever
God is pleased to reveal to us as a rule of duty, so that we are
made willing in the day of his power; and, as it respects the
affections, they are all inclined to run in a right channel, to desire,
delight and rejoice in every thing that is pleasing to God,
and flee from every thing that is provoking to him. This is that
whereby a dead sinner is made alive, and so enabled to put
forth living actions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning this principle of grace let it be observed, that it
is infused and not acquired. The first principle or spring of
good actions, may, with equal reason, be supposed to be infused
into us, as Christians, as it is undoubtedly true, that the
principle of reasoning is infused into us as men: none ever
supposed that the natural power of reasoning may be acquired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>though a greater facility or degree thereof is gradually attained;
so that power, whereby we are enabled to put forth supernatural
acts of grace, must be supposed to be implanted in us;
which, were it acquired, we could not, properly speaking, be
said to be born of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>From hence I am obliged to infer, that the regenerating act,
or implanting this principle<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> of grace, which is, at least, in
order of nature, antecedent to any act of grace, put forth by
us, is the immediate effect of the power of God, which none
who speak of regeneration as a divine work, pretend to deny:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and therefore, I cannot but conclude, that it is wrought in us
without the instrumentality of the word, or any of the ordinary
means of grace: my reason for it is this; because it is necessary,
from the nature of the thing, to our receiving, improving,
or reaping any saving advantage by the word, that the
Spirit should produce the principle of faith; and to say, that
this is done by the word, is in effect, to assert that the word
produces the principle, and the principle gives efficacy to the
word; which seems to me little less than arguing in a circle.
The word cannot profit, unless it be mixed with faith; and
faith cannot be put forth, unless it proceeds from a principle of
grace implanted; therefore this principle of grace is not produced
by it: we may as well suppose, that the presenting a
beautiful picture before a man that is blind, can enable him to
see; or the violent motion of a withered hand, produce strength
for action, as we can suppose that the presenting the word in
an objective way, is the instrument whereby God produces that
internal principle, by which we are enabled to embrace it. Neither
would this so well agree with the idea of its being a new
creature, or our being <i>created unto good works</i>; for then it
ought rather to be said, we are created by faith, which is a
good work: this is, in effect, to say, that the principle of grace
is produced by the instrumentality of that which supposes its
being implanted, and is the result and consequence thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sorry that I am obliged, in this assertion, to appear, at
least, to oppose what has been maintained by many divines of
great worth; who have, in all other respects, explained the
doctrine of regeneration, agreeably to the mind and will of God,
and the analogy of faith.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> It may be, the principal difference
between this explication and theirs is, that they speak of regeneration
in a large sense, as including in it, not barely the
implanting the principle, but the exciting it, and do not sufficiently
distinguish between the principle, as implanted and deduced
into act; for, I readily own, that the latter is by the instrumentality
of the word, though I cannot think the former
so; or, it may be, they consider the principle as exerted:
whereas I consider it as created, or wrought in us; and therefore
can no more conclude, that the new creation is wrought
by an instrument, than I can, that the first creation of all things
was.</p>

<p class='c006'>And I am ready to conjecture, that that which leads many
divines into this way of thinking, is the sense in which they
understand the words of the apostle; <i>Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
liveth and abideth for ever</i>, 1 Pet. i. 23. and elsewhere, <i>Of his
own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>a kind of first-fruits of his creatures</i>, James i. 16. Whereas
this does not so much respect the implanting the principle of
grace, as it does our being enabled to act from that principle;
and it is as though he should say, he hath made us believers,
or induced us to love and obey Him by the word of truth, which
supposes a principle of grace to have been implanted: otherwise
the word of truth would never have produced these effects.
Regeneration may be taken, not only for our being made alive
to God, or created unto good works, but for our putting forth
living actions, proceeding from that principle which is implanted
in the soul. I am far from denying, that faith, and all other
graces, are wrought in us by the instrumentality of the word;
and it is in this sense that some, who treat on this subject, explain
their sentiments, when they speak of being born again by
the word: therefore I persuade myself, that I differ from them
only in the acceptation of words, and not in the main substance
of the doctrine they maintain.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The principle of grace being implanted, the acts of grace
in those who are adult, immediately ensue; which implies a
change of our behaviour, a renovation of our lives and actions;
which may properly be called conversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having explained what we mean by regeneration, under our
last head, it is necessary, in this, to consider how it differs from
conversion; in which I shall take leave to transcribe a few passages
from that excellent divine, but now mentioned. “Regeneration
is a spiritual change; conversion is a spiritual
motion; in regeneration there is a power conferred; conversion
is the exercise of this power; in regeneration there
is given us a principle to turn; conversion is our actual
turning: in the covenant, the new heart, and God’s putting
the Spirit into them, is distinguished from their walking
in his statutes, from the first step we take, in the way
of God, and is set down as the cause of our motion: in
renewing us, God gives us a power; in converting us, he
excites that power. Men are naturally dead, and have a
stone upon them; regeneration is a rolling away the stone
from the heart, and a raising to newness of life; and then
conversion is as natural to a regenerate man, as motion
is to a lively body: a principle of activity will produce action.
The first reviving us is wholly the act of God, without
any concurrence of the creature; but, after we are revived,
we do actively and voluntarily live in his sight. Regeneration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>is the motion of God in the creature; conversion is the
motion of the creature to God, by virtue of that first principle;
from this principle all the acts of believing, repenting,
mortifying, quickening, do spring. In all these a man is active;
in the other, he is merely passive.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> This is what we
may call the second step, which God takes in effectual calling;
and it is brought about by the instrumentality of the word.
The word before this, was preached to little or no purpose; or,
it may be, was despised, rejected, and disregarded; but now
a man is enabled to see a beauty, and a glory in it, all the powers
and faculties of the soul, being under the influence of that
spiritual life implanted in regeneration, and inclined to yield a
ready and cheerful obedience to it; and this work is gradual
and progressive; and as such, it is called the work of sanctification;
of which more under a following answer,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and is attended
with repentance unto life, and all other graces that accompany
salvation; and in this respect we are drawn to Christ
by his word and Spirit, or by his Spirit making use of his word,
our minds savingly enlightened, our wills renewed, and determined
to what is good, so that hereby we are made willing and
able freely to answer the call of God, and to accept of, and embrace
the grace offered and conveyed therein; as it is expressed
in the answer we are explaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first thing in which that change, which is wrought in effectual
calling, manifests itself is, in our understandings’ being
enlightened to receive the truths revealed to us in the word of
God; and accordingly we see things with a new and different
light; behold a greater beauty, excellency and glory in divine
things, than ever we did before: we are also led into ourselves,
and convinced of sin and misery, concluding ourselves, by
nature, to be in a lost and undone condition; and then the soul
sees the glory of Christ, the greatness of his love, who came to
seek and save those that were lost, who is now precious to him,
as he is said to be to them that believe; and pursuant hereunto
the will, being determined, or enabled so to do, by the
Spirit of God exciting the principle of grace, which he had implanted,
accepts of him on his own terms; the affections all
centre in, and desire to derive all spiritual blessings from him;
Thus the work of grace is begun in effectual calling, which is
afterwards carried on in sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>And inasmuch as we are considering the beginning of the
work of grace in effectual calling, I cannot but take notice of
a question, which frequently occurs under this head, namely,
Whether man, in the first moment thereof, <i>viz.</i> in regeneration,
be merely passive, though active in every thing that follows
after it? This we cannot but affirm, not only against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Pelagians, but others, whose method of treating the doctrine of
divine grace, seems to agree with theirs. And here, that we
may obviate a popular objection, usually brought against our
assertion, as though hereby we argued, that God dealt with
men as though they were machines, and not endowed with
understanding or will let it be observed; that we consider the
subjects of this grace no otherwise than as intelligent creatures,
capable of being externally excited and disposed to what is
good; or else God would never work this principle in them.
Nor do we suppose, however men are said to be passive in the
first moment in which this principle is implanted, that they are
so afterwards, but are enabled to act under the divine influence;
even as when the soul of Adam was created at first, it
could not be said to be active in its own creation, and in the
implanting those powers which were concreate with it; yet it
was active, or those powers exerted themselves immediately
after it was created. This is the state of the question we are
now debating; and therefore we cannot but maintain, that men
do not concur to the implanting the principle of grace; for
then they would be active in being created unto good works;
which are the result, and not the cause of that power which is
infused into them, in order thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is sufficiently evident, not only from the impotency of
corrupt nature, as to what is good, but its utter averseness
thereunto, and from the work’s being truly and properly divine;
or (as has been before observed) the effect of almighty
power. This is not a controversy of late date; but has been
either defended or opposed, ever since Augustine’s and Pelagius’s
time. Many volumes have been written concerning the
aids and assistances of divine grace in the work of conversion.
The School-men were divided in their sentiments about it, as
they adhered to, or receded from Augustine’s doctrine: both
sides seem to allow that the grace of God affords some assistance
hereunto; but the main thing in debate, is, Whether the
grace of God only bears one part in this work, and the will of
man the other; like two persons lifting at the same burden, and
carrying it between them. Some have allowed the divine concourse
as necessary hereunto, who yet have not been willing to
own that man bears no part in this work; or, <i>that it is God that
works in us, both to will and to do of his own good pleasure</i>,
Phil. ii. 13. which, the apostle asserts in so plain terms, that
the most known sense thereof, cannot well be evaded; and, indeed,
were it otherwise, it could hardly be said, that <i>we are
not sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as of ourselves</i>;
which, though it be immediately applied to ministers, is certainly,
by a parity of reason, applicable to all Christians, 2 Cor.
iii. 5. nor would it be, in all respects, true, that we are <i>born of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>God</i>; or, that we, who before were dead in sin, are raised to a
spiritual life, or made, with respect to the principle of spiritual
actions, new creatures; all which is done in regeneration.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>We might also take occasion, under this head, to observe,
what we often meet with in practical discourses and sermons,
concerning preparatory works, or previous dispositions, which
facilitate and lead to the work of conversion. Some assert, that
we must do what we can, and by using our reasoning powers
and faculties, endeavour to convert, or turn ourselves, and then
God will do the rest, or finish the work which we have begun:
and here many things are often considered as the steps which
men may take in the reformation of their lives, the abstaining
from gross enormities, which they may have been guilty of,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>thinking on their ways, and observing the tendency of their
present course of life, and setting before themselves those proper
arguments that may induce them to repent and believe;
and then they may be said to have prepared themselves for the
grace of God, so that it will ensue hereupon. And if there be
any thing remaining, which is out of their power, God has engaged
to succeed their endeavours, so that he will bring them
into a state of regeneration and conversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method of accounting for the work of grace, is liable
to many exceptions, particularly as it supposes man to be the
first mover in his own conversion, and the divine energy to be
dependent upon our conduct; the contrary to which, is not only
agreeable to scripture, but the divine perfections; as well as
to the doctrine we have been maintaining, concerning effectual
calling’s, being a divine work in the most proper sense thereof.
But that we may impartially consider this matter, and set, what
some call a preparatory work, in a just light, let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That these preparatory works must either be considered
as good in all those circumstances that are necessary to denominate
them good, and particularly they must proceed from a
good principle, that is to say, a principle of regeneration; or
else they are only such works as are materially good, such
many perform who are never brought into a state of conversion;
or if, on the other hand, they are supposed to proceed
from such a principle, then they are not, from the nature of
the thing, works preparatory to the first grace, but rather consequent
upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is one thing for us to assert, that it is our duty to perform
all those works which some call preparatory, for conversion;
such as meditation, attendance on the ordinances, duly
weighing those arguments, or motives, that should lead us to
repentance, and the exercise of all other graces; and another
thing to say, that every one who performs these duties, shall
certainly have regenerating grace; or, it is one thing to apply
ourselves to the performance of those duties, as far as it is in
our own power, and, at the same time, to wait, pray, and hope
for success to attend them; and another thing to assert, that it
shall always attend them, as though God had laid himself under
an obligation to give special grace to those, who, in this
respect, improve that which is common, the contrary whereunto
may be observed in many instances. And when we have
done all, we must conclude, that the grace of God, if he is
pleased to give success to our endeavours, is free and sovereign.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They who say, That if we do all we can, God will do the
rest, advance very little to support their argument, since there
is no one who can pretend that he has done what he could:
and may we not farther suppose, that God, in a judicial way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>as punishing us for the many sins we commit, may deny this
success: therefore, how can it be said, that it will necessarily
ensue.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When we perform any of those duties, which some call
preparatory to conversion, these are to be considered as the
Spirit’s preparing his own way thereby, rather than corrupt nature’s
preparing itself for grace. We are far from denying
that there is a beautiful order in the divine dispensations; the
Spirit of God first convinces of sin, and then shews the convinced
sinner where his help is to be had; and enables him to
close with Christ by faith. He first shews the soul its own corruption
and nothingness, and then leads him to see Christ’s
fulness; or that all his salvation is reposed in his hands, and
enables him to believe in him to the saving the soul; one of
these works, indeed, prepares the way for the other: nevertheless,
none of them can be said to prepare the way for regeneration,
which is the work of the Spirit of God; and without it,
no other can be said to be a saving work.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected, that there are several scriptures which
seem to speak of common grace, as being preparatory for special.
Thus the scribe, mentioned in the gospel, who expressed
himself <i>discreetly</i>, in asserting, that <i>to love God with all the
heart, and with all the understanding, soul, and strength; and
to love our neighbour as ourselves, is better than all whole burnt-offerings
and sacrifices</i>, is said not to be <i>far from the kingdom
of God</i>, Mark xii. 34. And elsewhere, we are exhorted <i>to ask</i>,
and a promise is annexed thereunto, that <i>it shall be given us,
to seek and we shall find</i>, Matt. vii. 7. And in another place,
<i>to turn at God’s reproof and he will pour out his Spirit</i> unto
us, <i>and make known his words unto us</i>, Prov. i. 25. And several
other scriptures, in which super-added grace is connected
with duty enjoined, which duty is supposed to be in our own
power, and to be preparatory for it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> (1.) As to the first of these scriptures, in which our
Saviour tells the scribe, that he was not <i>far from the kingdom
of God</i>; he intends nothing else hereby, but that the profession
he made, which he calls, his <i>answering discreetly</i>, was not very
remote from that which was made by them, who were the subjects
of his kingdom: it was the doctrine he mentions, that
Christ commends; and therefore it must not be inferred from
hence, that he had regard to his state, as though his inward
temper of mind, or moral conduct of life, was such as more
immediately disposed him for a state of grace, so that he was,
at the same time, hovering between a state of unregeneracy
and conversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As for that instance, in which persons are supposed to
prepare themselves for that grace which God gives in answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to prayer, by performing that duty, as though he had obliged
himself to give whatever they ask for, relating to their own
salvation; this cannot be the sense of the scripture but now
mentioned, or any other, to the like purpose; unless it be understood
of the prayer of faith, under the influence of the Holy
Spirit; but this supposes regenerating grace; and therefore it
is foreign to the argument, in which man is considered as preparing
himself for the grace of God, and not as expecting farther
degrees of grace, upon his being inclined, by the Spirit
of God, to seek them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) As for the other instance in the objection, relating to
God’s engaging <i>to give the Spirit</i>, and to <i>make known his words</i>
to those that <i>turn at his reproof</i>; this, I conceive, contains in
it nothing else but a promise of the Spirit, to carry on the work
of grace, in all those in whom it is begun. Though <i>turning</i>, in
scripture, be sometimes taken for external reformation, which
is in our own power, as it is our indispensable duty; yet, whenever
a promise of saving blessings is annexed to it, as in this
scripture, it is to be understood as denoting the grace of repentance.
And if it be said, that this is God’s gift, and therefore
cannot be the subject of an exhortation, it may be replied
hereunto; that saving grace is often represented, in scripture,
as our act, or duty, in order to the performance whereof we
ought to say, as the church is presented speaking, <i>Turn thou
me, and I shall be turned</i>, Jer. xxxi. 18. that is, I <i>shall return
unto thee with my whole heart, and not feignedly</i>, chap. iii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same reply might be given to their sense of several other
scriptures brought to maintain the doctrine of preparatory
works, performed by us, as necessarily inferring our obtaining
the special grace of God. But I shall close this head with a
few hints taken from that excellent divine before mentioned.
“Man cannot prepare himself for the new birth: he hath, indeed,
a subjective capacity for grace, above any other creature
in the inferior world; and this is a kind of natural preparation,
which other creatures have not; a capacity, in regard
of the powers of the soul, though not in respect of the
present disposition of them. He hath an understanding to
know, and when it is enlightened, to know God’s law; a will
to move and run, and when enlarged by grace, to run the
ways of God’s commandments; so that he stands in an immediate
capacity to receive the life of grace, upon the breath
and touch of God, which a stone doth not; for in this it is
necessary, that rational faculties should be put as a foundation
of spiritual motions. Though the soul be thus capable,
as a subject, to receive the grace of God, yet it is not therefore
capable, as an agent, to prepare itself for it, or produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>it. It is capable to receive the truths of God; but, as the
heart is stony, it is incapable to receive the impressions of
those truths. Though some things, which man may do by
common grace, may be said to be preparations, yet they are
not formally so; as that there is an absolute, causal connexion
between such preparations, and regeneration; they are not
disposing causes of grace: grace is all in a way of reception
by the soul, not of action from the soul: the highest morality
in the world is not necessary to the first infusion of the
divine nature: if there were any thing in the subject that
was the cause of it, the tenderest, and softest dispositions
would be wrought upon; and the most intelligent men would
soonest receive the gospel. Though we see them sometimes
renewed, yet many times the roughest tempers are seized
upon by grace. Though morality seems to set men at a
greater nearness to the kingdom of God, yet, with all its own
strength it cannot bring it into the heart, unless the Spirit
open the lock: yea, sometimes it sets a man farther from the
kingdom of God, as being a great enemy to the righteousness
of the gospel, both imputed and inherent; and other
operations upon the soul, which seem to be nearer preparations;
such as convictions, &amp;c. do not infer grace; for the
heart, as a field, may be ploughed by terrors, and yet not
planted with any good seed; planting and watering are preparations,
but not the cause of fruit; the increase depends
upon God:”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> thus this learned author. And he also farther
proves, that there is no obligation on God, by any thing that
may look like a preparation in men; and adds, that if any preparations
were our own, and were pure, which they are not:
yet they cannot oblige God to give supernatural grace: which
leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. To consider that this work is, in a peculiar manner, attributed
to the Spirit of God; the only moving cause whereof,
is his grace. That the Spirit is the author of this work, is not
to be proved by experience, as the expressions of divine power
therein are, but by scripture; and the scripture is very express
as to this matter. Thus, when God promises to <i>give a new
heart; to take away the heart of stone, and to give an heart of
flesh, and to cause his people to walk in his statutes</i>, Ezek.
xxxvi. 26, 27. he would <i>put his Spirit within them</i>; and elsewhere
they are said to have <i>purified their souls in obeying the
truth, through the Spirit</i>, 1 Pet. i. 22. And our Saviour asserts
the necessity of our being <i>born of the Spirit</i>, John iii. 5.
in order to our entering into the kingdom of God: so that from
these, and several other scriptures, that might be referred to,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>it appears, that effectual calling is the internal powerful work
of the Holy Ghost.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj. 1.</i> It is objected, by some, that this doctrine savours
of enthusiasm; since it supposes that there is no difference between
the Spirit’s internal influences, and inspiration; and to
pretend to this, now the miraculous dispensation, which was in
the apostle’s days, is ceased, is vain and enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That the charge of enthusiasm
is very unjustly deduced from this doctrine; for we must
distinguish between the extraordinary, and the ordinary influence
of the Holy Ghost; the former is allowed by all, to be
now ceased; and therefore they who pretend to it, are liable
to this charge; but it is a very great dishonour cast upon the
Holy Ghost to deny his powerful influence or agency in the
work of grace; and it renders the condition of the church, at
present, in a very material circumstance, so much inferior to
what it was of old, that it is incapable of attaining salvation;
unless it could be proved that salvation might be attained without
the divine energy.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, that we may farther reply to this objection, let it be considered;
that the Spirit’s influence, as subservient to the work
of grace, is evidently distinguished from imputation: the latter
of these was a peculiar honour which was conferred upon
some persons, who were either to transmit to the church a rule
of faith, by the immediate dictates of the Holy Ghost; or else
they were favoured with it to answer some extraordinary ends,
which could not be attained without it, namely, their being
furnished with wisdom, as well as courage and boldness, to
maintain the cause, which they were not otherwise furnished to
defend, against the opposition that it met with from their persecuting
and malicious enemies, that so it might not suffer
through their weakness; as when our Saviour bids his disciples
<i>not to take thought what they should say</i>, when brought before
rulers, <i>&amp;c.</i> but promises, that <i>the Spirit should speak in
them</i>, Matt. x. 18-20. And in some other particular instances
we read, especially in the church at Corinth, that when
ministers had not those advantages to qualify themselves to
preach the gospel, which they afterwards were favoured with,
some had this extraordinary gift, so that they spake by the
Spirit; but this was only conferred occasionally, and for some
special reasons: and therefore, those scriptures that speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the influences of the Spirit, which were more common, and
immediately subservient to the work of grace in the souls of
those who were the subjects thereof, were, at that time, the
same with them that we are pleading for, which were designed
to continue in the church, in all the ages thereof: thus
when persons are said, <i>through the Spirit to mortify the deeds
of the body</i>, Rom. viii. 13. this does not respect any extraordinary
dispensation, which they were then under, since it is
the duty of all men, in all ages, without the extraordinary influences
of the Spirit, to mortify the deeds of the body; and
therefore we may expect this powerful energy as well as they,
or else our condition would be very deplorable.</p>

<p class='c006'>And besides, we never find that extraordinary gifts were
immediately subservient to the subduing corruption, or, at least,
that every one that had them, did mortify sin, and so appear
to be internally sanctified: whereas, this is a character of those
who are so; and not to have these influences, determines a person
to be in an unregenerate state, or <i>to live after the flesh</i>,
which is opposed to it, and so to be liable to death, ver. 12.
No one can suppose, the apostle intends, in the foregoing verse,
when he says, <i>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die</i>; that if ye
are not under inspiration, ye shall die, as living after the flesh:
but the method of reasoning is strong and conclusive, if we
understand the divine influence as what is distinct from inspiration,
and consequently a privilege necessary for the beginning
and carrying on the work of grace, and so belongs to believers
in all ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when the Spirit is said <i>to help our infirmities</i>, ver.
26. in prayer: is not prayer as much a duty now as it was
when they had extraordinary gifts? therefore, ought we not
to hope for the assistance of the Spirit, in all ages? and consequently
the Spirit’s help, in this respect is not confined to that
age, when there was a miraculous dispensation, or extraordinary
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when it is elsewhere said, <i>As many as are led by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God</i>, ver. 14. can we suppose,
that none were the sons of God but such as had extraordinary
gifts? Does not this privilege belong to us, as well as
unto them? If therefore we are the sons of God, as well as
they, we have this evidence hereof, according to this scripture;
namely, our <i>being led by the Spirit of God</i>; though we pretend
not to be led by him, as a Spirit of inspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that the apostle elsewhere speaks
of some who were <i>sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise;
which is the earnest of our inheritance</i>: and these are described
as <i>trusting in Christ after they had heard the word of salvation</i>,
and <i>believing in him</i>, Eph. i. 13, 14. But this belongs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to the church in all ages; therefore sealing is not a privilege
confined to those who had the extraordinary gifts of the Holy
Ghost; but to believers as such.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is said, <i>The Spirit beareth witness with our
spirits, that we are the children of God</i>, Rom. viii. 16. Therefore,
some persons may know themselves to be the children of
God, in a way of self-examination, by the witness of the Spirit,
which is common to all believers; without pretending to be
inspired therein; which would be to know this matter without
the concurring testimony of our own spirits. Many things, of
the like nature, might be observed, concerning the other scriptures,
that are generally brought to prove, that believers, in our
day, are made partakers of the powerful influences of the Holy
Ghost; though they pretend not to the Spirit of inspiration;
which is a sufficient answer to this objection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 2. If it be farther objected, that if the Spirit does
work internally in the souls of men, we are not to suppose, that
he works a change in their wills, but only presents objects to
them, which they by their own power, improve, and make use
of, for their good; even as a finite Spirit may suggest good or
bad thoughts, without disposing us to comply with them; or,
as the devil is said to work in men, who is called, <i>The Spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience</i>, Eph. ii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that an objective influence,
properly speaking, is no influence at all; much less is it becoming
the dignity of the Holy Ghost, to say, That he hath no
more an hand in the work of conversion, than that which a
mere creature might have. I will not deny that the Greek
word,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> which signifies energy, or internal working, is sometimes
taken for such a kind of influence as is not properly the
effect of power, as in the instance contained in the objection;
yet, let it be considered, that the same word is often used, in
various other instances, in senses very different, when applied
to God and the creature; where the word, in itself, is indeterminate;
but the application of it sufficiently determines the
matter; so as to leave no doubt, as to the sense of it. Thus to
make, form, or produce, when applied to God, and the thing
made, formed, or produced, is represented as an instance of
his almighty power, which exceeds the limits of finite power,
this determines the sense to be very different from making,
forming, or producing, when applied to men, acting in their
own sphere: so the apostle speaks of building, in a very different
sense, as applied to God and the creature, which no one
is at a loss to understand, who reads the words; <i>Every house
is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God</i>, Heb.
iii. 4. Now, to apply this to our present purpose, we do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>deny, that a finite spirit has an energy, in an objective way;
but when the same word is applied to God’s manner of acting;
and is represented as has been before observed, as an instance
of his almighty power, producing a change in the soul; and
not only persuading, but enabling him to perform good works,
from a principle of spiritual life, implanted, this may easily be
understood as having a very different sense from the same
word, when applied to the internal agency of a finite spirit;
and therefore this objection does not overthrow the argument
we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 3. It is farther objected against what has been said
concerning this powerful work of the Spirit, as being illustrated
by the similitude of a person’s being raised from the dead;
that this contains in it nothing supernatural, or out of the power
of man; since the apostle says, <i>Awake thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and Christ shall give the light</i>, Eph. v. 14.
If arising from the dead be the effect of almighty power, when
applied to the work of grace, it seems preposterous for this to
be recommended as our duty: and if it be not a work of almighty
power, then those scriptures that illustrate effectual
calling by the resurrection of the dead, are nothing to the argument
for which they have been brought.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> Some suppose, that its being assigned as a matter of
duty for sinners to rise from the dead, does not infer, that it is
in their own power; but, that it only signifies, that none can
expect eternal life but those who rise from the death of sin;
and accordingly, as the promise, here mentioned, relating to
our <i>having light</i>, is said to be <i>Christ’s gift</i>, so the power to
perform that duty, which is inseparably connected with it, to
wit, <i>rising from the dead</i>, is to be sought for at his hand. But
if this answer be not reckoned sufficient, I see no absurdity in
supposing, that these two expressions, <i>Awake, thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead</i>, import the same thing. Sleep is, as it
were, the image of death; and therefore, by a metaphorical
way of speaking, it may be here called <i>death</i>; and if so, the
apostle commands believers to awake out of their carnal security,
or shake off their stupid frames, as they expect the light
of eternal life: however, if it be taken in this sense here; yet
when we meet with the words <i>quickened</i>, or <i>raised from the
dead</i>, elsewhere, they may be understood in a different sense,
as denoting the implanting a principle of grace in regeneration,
as will appear by the context: thus when God is said to <i>quicken
those who were dead in trespasses and sins; who walked according
to the course of this world, fulfilling the desires of the flesh,
and of the mind; and were, by nature, the children of wrath</i>;
and to do this with a design to shew the <i>exceeding riches of
his grace, and kindness towards them</i>; and as the consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>thereof, to work that faith which accompanies salvation, which
is not of themselves, but his gift: I say, if these things are
mentioned when we are said to be <i>quickened</i>, or <i>raised from
the dead</i>, certainly it argues more than a stupid believer’s awaking
from that carnal security, which he is under, who is supposed
to have a principle of spiritual life, whereby he may be
enabled so to do.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 4. It is also objected to what has been said, concerning
effectual calling’s being a work of divine power, that those
scriptures, which speak of it as such, denote nothing else but
the power of working miracles; whereby they to whom the
gospel was preached, were induced to believe; as when the
apostle says, <i>His preaching was in demonstration of the Spirit,
and of power</i>, 1 Cor. ii. 4. that is, the doctrines he preached,
were confirmed, and the truth thereof demonstrated by the
power of the Holy Ghost, enabling them to work miracles: and
<i>the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power</i>, chap. iv. 20.
that is, the gospel is not only preached, but confirmed by miracles:
<i>Our gospel came to you in power, and in the Holy
Ghost</i>, 1 Thes. i. 5. that is, as some understand it, the gospel
which we preach, was confirmed by the power and miraculous
works of the Holy Ghost; which has no reference to the internal
efficacious influences of the Spirit put forth in effectual
calling.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> Though we often read that the gospel was confirmed
by miracles: nevertheless, I cannot see that this is the principle,
much less the only sense of these scriptures, and some
others that might have been produced to the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the first of them in which the apostle speaks <i>of his
preaching, being in the demonstration of the Spirit, and of
power</i>; it may be observed, that in the preceding chapter he
had been speaking concerning Christ preached, and his glory
set forth among them, as the power of God; that is to say,
the power of God rendered the preaching thereof effectual to
the conversion of them that believed; which he concludes to
contain in it no less a conviction of the truth of the Christian
religion, than if he had wrought signs or miracles, which the
Jews demanded, and which he had no design to work among
them: therefore, why should we suppose, that when he speaks
<i>of his preaching being in the demonstration of the Spirit, and
of power</i>, that he intends the confirming his doctrine by miracles,
and not in the same sense as he had before signified Christ
to be the power of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for the other scripture, in which it is said, <i>The kingdom
of God is not in word, but in power</i>; that is to be understood
by comparing it with what immediately goes before, in
which he says, that <i>I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and know not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the
power</i>. It we suppose, that by <i>them who are puffed up</i>, he means
some of their teachers, who swelled either with pride or envy,
and probably were sowing some seeds of error among them; it
does not seem to be a just sense of the text, to explain the words
when he says, <i>I will know not the speech of them who are puffed
up, but the power</i>, q. d. I will not so much regard the doctrines
they deliver, as I will enquire and be convinced, that they have
confirmed them by miracles. For he would rather regard their
doctrine than their pretence to miracles; or have said, I will not
enquire whether ever they have wrought any miracles or no, but
what efficacy their doctrine has had: and therefore the apostle,
by <i>knowing the power</i>, does not mean that of working miracles,
but he intimates that he would know, not only what doctrines
these persons taught, but what success attended their
preaching; and then he adds, that <i>the kingdom of God</i>, that is,
the gospel-state is advanced and promoted, not barely by the
church’s enjoying the means of grace, such as the preaching of
the word; but <i>by the power of God</i>, which makes the word
preached effectual to salvation, whereby sinners are converted,
and many added to the church, such as shall be saved.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the last scripture mentioned, in which the apostle says,
<i>Our gospel came to you, not in word only, but in power</i>, I cannot
think that he has any reference in that place, to the confirming
the gospel by miracles; because this is assigned as a
mark of their election, <i>knowing, brethren, your election of God;
for our gospel came unto you, not only in word, but in power</i>,
&amp;c. Now, whether we take election for God’s eternal design
to save them, or for the execution thereof, in his applying the
graces of the Spirit to them; or if we take it in the lowest
sense, which they, on the other side of the question, generally
give into, for their being a choice, religious unblameable society
of Christians, excelling many others in piety: this could
not be evinced by the gospel’s being confirmed by miracles;
and therefore this sense seems not agreeable to the apostle’s
design; and consequently the objection taken from those scriptures,
that speak of the power of God in conversion, as implying
nothing else but his power, exerted in working miracles,
will not, in the least, be sufficient to weaken the force of the
argument we are maintaining. Thus concerning effectual calling’s
being a work of power, attributed, in particular, to the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one thing more observed, in the answer we are explaining,
which must be briefly considered; namely, that it is a
work of grace, which was the internal moving cause thereof;
or, the reason of God’s exerting his divine power therein. Effectual
calling must be a work of grace, without any motive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>taken from them, who are the subjects thereof; inasmuch as
they had before this, nothing in them, that could render them
the objects of divine love, being described as <i>dead in trespasses
and sins, alienated from the life of God</i>, and <i>enmity</i> itself
<i>against him</i>: so that their condition, antecedent hereunto, cannot
be supposed to be the moving cause hereof; for that which
is in itself, altogether unlovely, cannot afford a motive for love
to any one that weighs the circumstances of persons and things,
and acts in pursuance thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> But whereas it is objected, that though the present
condition of unregenerate persons cannot afford any motive inducing
God thereunto, yet the foresight of their future conduct
might.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this we answer, That all the good which shall be
found in believers, is God’s gift; he is the finisher as well as
the author of faith; and therefore it cannot be said, that any
thing out of himself, was the moving cause hereof. And to
this we may add, That God foresaw the vile and unworthy
behaviour of believers, proceeding from the remainders of corrupt
nature in them, as well as those graces which he would
enable them to act: so that there is as much in them that might
induce him to hate them, as there is to move him to love them;
and therefore we must conclude, that his love proceeds from
another cause; or that it is by the grace of God alone, that we
are what we are: which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. That the power and grace of God, displayed in effectual
calling, is irresistible, and consequently such as cannot but be
effectual to produce that which is designed to be brought about
thereby. To deny this, would be to infer, that the creature has
an equal, if not a superior, force to God: for, as, in nature,
every thing that impedes or stops a thing that is in motion,
must have an equal force to resist with that which is affected
by it; so, in the work of grace, if the will of man can render
the power of God of none effect, or stop the progress of divine
grace, contrary to his design or purpose, this must argue the
creature’s power of resisting, equal to that which is put forth
by God, in order to the bringing this work to perfection. This
consequence is so derogatory to the divine glory, that no one
who sees it to be just, will maintain the premises from whence
it is deduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be said, that God may suffer himself to be resisted;
and his grace, that would otherwise have been effectual, to be
defeated; this will not much mend the matter; but only, in order
to the avoiding one absurd consequence, bring in another;
for if every one would have, what he purposes to be done
brought to pass, and would not be disappointed, if he could
help it, the same must be said of the great God. Now if God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>could have prevented his purpose from being defeated, but
would not, this argues a defect of wisdom; if his own glory
was designed, by purposing to do that which the creature renders
ineffectual, then he misses of that end, which cannot but be
the most valuable, and consequently most desirable: therefore,
for God to suffer a purpose of this nature, to be defeated, supposing
he could prevent it, is to suffer himself to be a loser of
that glory which is due to his name. Moreover, this is directly
contrary to what the apostle says, <i>Who hath resisted his will</i>,
Rom. ix. 19. or who hath rendered the grace, which he designed
should take effect, ineffectual, or, which is the same thing,
who can do it?</p>

<p class='c006'>The ground on which many have asserted, that the grace of
God may be resisted, is taken from some scriptures, that speak
of man’s being in open hostility against him. Thus we read of
a bold daring sinner, as <i>stretching out his hand against God,
and strengthening himself against the Almighty, running upon
him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers</i>, Job
xv. 25, 26. And Stephen reproves the Jews as having <i>always
resisted the Holy Ghost, both they and their fathers</i>, Acts vii.
51, 52. and the Pharisees are said to <i>have rejected</i>, Luke vii.
30. or, as the word<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> might have been rendered, <i>disannulled
the counsel of God against themselves</i>. And elsewhere, the prophet
speaks of God’s <i>stretching out his hand all the day unto
a disobedient and gainsaying people</i>, Rom. x. 21. These, and
such like scriptures give occasion to some to suppose, that the
power and grace, as well as the purpose of God, may be resisted.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that we may understand the sense of these scriptures,
and, at the same time not relinquish the doctrine we are maintaining,
and thereby infer the consequence above-mentioned;
we must distinguish between our opposition to God’s revealed
will, contained in his word, which is the rule of duty to us;
and resisting his secret will, which determines the event. Or,
as it may be otherwise expressed, it is one thing to set ourselves
against the objective grace of God, that is, the gospel,
and another thing to defeat his subjective grace, that when he
is about to work effectually in us, we should put a stop to his
proceedings. The former no one denies; the latter we can, by
no means, allow of. Persons may express a great deal of reluctancy
and perverseness at that time, when God is about to
subdue their stubborn and obstinate wills; but the power of
God will break through all this opposition; and the will of man
shall not be able to make his work void, or without effect. The
Jews, as above-mentioned, might <i>resist the Holy Ghost</i>, that
is, oppose the doctrines contained in scripture, which were given
by the Spirit’s inspiration; and they might make this revelation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of no effect, with respect to themselves; but had God
designed that it should take effect, then he would have prevented
their resisting it. Israel might <i>be a gainsaying people</i>,
that is, they might oppose what God communicated to them
by the prophets, which it was their duty and interest to have
complied with; and so the offers of grace in God’s revealed
will, might be in vain with respect to them; but it never was
so with respect to those whom he designed to save: and if the
hardened sinner, <i>stretching out his hand against God</i>, may be
said hereby to express his averseness to holiness, and his desire
to be exempted from the divine government; he may be
found in open rebellion against him, as hating and opposing his
law; but he cannot offer any real injury to his divine perfections,
so as to detract from his glory, to render his purpose of
no effect. Moses speaking concerning God’s works of providence,
says, <i>They are perfect; for all his ways are judgment</i>,
Deut. xxxii. 4. And elsewhere, God, by the prophet Isaiah,
says, <i>I will work, and who shall let it</i>, Isa. xliii. 13. From
whence he argues, his eternal Deity, and uncontroulable power,
when he says, <i>before the day was, I am he, and there is none
that can deliver out of my hand</i>; so that if a stop might be put
to his works of providence, he would cease to be a God of infinite
perfection; and may we not from hence infer, that his
works of grace are not subject to any controul; so that when
he designs to call any effectually, nothing shall prevent this
end’s being answered, which is what we intend, when we
speak of the power and grace of God as irresistible; which
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The season or time in which persons are effectually called;
which in this answer, is said to be God’s accepted time.
If the work be free and sovereign, without any motive in us,
the time in which he does it, must be that which he thinks most
proper. Here we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That some are regenerate in their infancy, when the
word can have no instrumentality, in producing the least acts
of grace; these have therefore the seeds thereof, which spring
up, and discover themselves, when they are able to make use
of the word. That persons are capable of regeneration from the
womb, is no less evident, than that they are capable of having
the seeds or principle of reason from thence, which they certainly
have; and if it be allowed, that regeneration is connected
with salvation, and that infants are capable of the latter,
as our Saviour says, that <i>of such is the kingdom of God</i>; then
they must be certainly capable of the former; and not to suppose
some infants regenerate from the womb, would be to exclude
a very great part of mankind from salvation, without
scripture-warrant.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>(2.) Others are effectually called in their childhood, or riper
years, and some few in old age; that so no age of life may be
an inducement to despair, or persons be thereby discouraged
from attending on the means of grace. Thus it is said concerning
Josiah, That <i>in the eighth year of his reign, while he
was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David, his
father</i>, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 1. and David was converted when he
was a <i>youth, a stripling of a ruddy and beautiful countenance</i>,
1 Sam. xvi. 12. compared with chap. xvii. 56, 58. And Moses
seems to have been effectually called, when he left Pharaoh’s
court; and <i>it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children
of Israel</i>; at which time he was <i>forty years old</i>, Acts vii.
23. And Abraham seems to have been made partaker of this
grace, when he was called to leave his country, when he was
seventy-five years old; before which, it is probable, that he,
together with the rest of his father’s family, served other gods,
Josh. xxiv. 2. compared with Gen. xii. 4. And we read, in
one single instance, of a person converted in the very agonies
of death, <i>viz.</i> the thief upon the cross, Luke xxiii. 43.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Sometimes, when persons seem most disposed hereunto,
and are under the greatest convictions, and more inclined to
reform their lives, than at other times, the work appears, by
the issue thereof, to be no more than that of common grace,
which miscarries and leaves them worse than they were before;
and, it may be, after this, when they seem less inclined hereunto,
that is, God’s accepted time, when he begins the work
with power, which he afterwards carries on and completes.
Some are suffered to run great lengths in sin, before they are
effectually called; as the apostle Paul, <i>in whom God was pleased
to shew forth all long suffering, as a pattern to them which
should hereafter believe</i>, 1 Tim. i. 16. So that the time and
means being entirely in his hand, as we ought not to presume,
but wait for the day of salvation in all his ordinances; so, whatever
our age and circumstances are, we are still encouraged to
hope for the mercy of God, unto eternal life; or, that he will
save and call us, with an holy calling.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXIX. <i>What is the communion in grace, which the
members of the invisible church have with Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The communion in grace, which the members of the
invisible church have with Christ, is, their partaking of the
virtue of his mediation, in their justification, adoption, sanctification,
and whatever else, in this life, manifests their
union with him.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Having considered the vital union which the members
of the invisible church have with Christ in their effectual
calling, we are now led to speak concerning that communion
in grace, which they have with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Communion with Christ doth not, in the least, import our
being made partakers of any of the glories or privileges which
belong to him as Mediator; but it consists, in our participation,
of those benefits which he hath purchased for us; and it implies,
on his part, infinite condescension, that he will be pleased
to communicate such blessings on us, and on our’s, unspeakable
honours and privileges, which we enjoy from him: it is
sometimes called <i>fellowship</i>, 1 John i. 3. which is the result of
friendship, and proceeds from his love: thus our Saviour speaks
of his <i>loving them, and manifesting himself unto them</i>, John
xiv. 21. It also proceeds from union with him, and is the immediate
effect and consequence of effectual calling: therefore
God is said to <i>have called us unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus
Christ</i>, 1 Cor. i. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is farther said in this answer, to be a manifestation
of our union with him. He has received those blessings for us,
which he purchased by his blood; and, accordingly is the treasury,
as well as the fountain of all grace; and we are therefore
said to <i>receive of his fulness, grace for grace</i>, John i. 16.
And the blessings which we are said to receive, by virtue of
his mediation, are justification, adoption, and sanctification,
with all other benefits that either accompany or flow from them;
which are particularly explained in the following answers.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-70' class='c003'>Quest. LXX., LXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXX. <i>What is justification?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Justification is an act of God’s free grace unto sinners,
in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth
their persons righteous in his sight; not for any thing
wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the perfect
obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to
them, and received by faith alone.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXXI. <i>How is justification an act of God’s free
grace?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make
a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God’s justice, in the
behalf of them that are justified; yet, inasmuch as God accepteth
the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have
demanded of them, did provide this surety, his own only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Son, imputing his righteousness to them, and requiring nothing
of them for their justification, but faith; which also is
his gift; their justification is, to them, of free grace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hitherto we have been led to consider that change of
heart and life which is begun in effectual calling; whereby
a dead sinner is made alive, and one that was wholly indisposed
for, and averse to the performance of good works, is
enabled to perform them by the power of divine grace: and
now we are to speak concerning that change of state which accompanies
it; whereby one, who being guilty before God, was
liable to the condemning sentence of the law, and expected no
other than an eternal banishment from his presence, is pardoned,
received into favour, and has a right to all the blessings
which Christ has, by his obedience and sufferings, purchased
for him. This is what we call justification; and it is placed
immediately after the head of effectual calling, as being agreeable
to the method in which it is insisted on in that golden
chain of salvation, as the apostle says, <i>Whom he called, them he
also justified</i>, Rom. viii. 30.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is certainly a doctrine of the highest importance, inasmuch
as it contains in it the way of peace, the foundation of
all our hope, of the acceptance both of our persons and services,
and beholding the face of God, at last, with joy. Some
have styled it the very <i>basis</i> of Christianity; and our forefathers
thought it so necessary to be insisted on and maintained,
according to the scripture-account thereof, that they
reckoned it one of the principal doctrines of the reformation.
And, indeed, the apostle Paul speaks of it as so necessary to
be believed, that he concluded that the denying or perverting
of it was the ground and reason of the Jews being rejected;
<i>who being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to
establish a righteousness of their own, have not submitted themselves
to the righteousness of God</i>: and when they shall be called,
if their call be intended, in that account which we have, of
<i>the marriage of the Lamb, and his wife having made herself
ready</i>, Rev. xix. 7. as many suppose, it is worth observing,
that she is described as <i>arrayed in fine linen, which is the righteousness
of saints</i>, or Christ’s righteousness, by which they
are justified: this is that in which they glory; and therefore
are represented as being convinced of the importance of that
doctrine which, before, they were ignorant of. This we have
an account of in these two answers, which we are now to explain,
and shall endeavour to do it in the following method.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider what we are to understand by the word
<i>justify</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. What are the privileges contained therein, as reduced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>two heads, to wit, pardon of sin; and God’s accounting them
who are justified, righteous in his sight? And,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What is the foundation of our justification? namely, a
righteousness wrought out for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. The utter inability of fallen man to perform any righteousness,
that can be the matter of his justification in the
sight of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. That our Lord Jesus Christ has wrought out this righteousness
for us, as our surety, by performing active and passive
obedience; which is imputed to us for our justification.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. We shall consider it as an act of God’s free grace. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. Shew the use of faith in justification, or in what respects
faith is said to justify.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider in what sense we are to understand the
word <i>justify</i>. As there are many disputes about the method
of explaining the doctrines of justification; so there is a contest
between us and the Papists, about the sense of the word;
they generally supposing, that <i>to justify</i>, is to make inherently
righteous and holy; because righteousness and holiness sometimes
import the same thing; and both of them denote an internal
change in the person who is so denominated; and accordingly
they argue, that as to <i>magnify</i> signifies to make
great; to <i>fortify</i>, to make strong; so to <i>justify</i> is to make just
or holy: and they suppose, that whatever we do to make ourselves
so, or whatever good works are the ingredients of our
sanctification, these must be considered as the matter of our
justification. And some Protestant divines have supposed, that
the difference between them and us, is principally about the
sense of a word; which favourable and charitable construction
of their doctrine, would have been less exceptionable, if the
Papists had asserted no more than that justification might have
been taken in this sense, when considered, not as giving us a
right to eternal life, or being the foundation of that sentence of
absolution, which God passes upon us: but since this is the
sense they give of it, when they say that we are justified by
our inherent holiness, we are bound to conclude, that it is very
remote from the scripture sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c006'>We do not deny that justification is sometimes taken in a
sense different from that which is intended by it, when used to
signify the doctrine we are explaining. Sometimes nothing more
is intended hereby, than our vindicating the divine perfections
from any charge which is pretended to be brought against them.
Thus the Psalmist says, <i>That thou mightest be justified when
thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest</i>, Psal. li. 4. And
our Saviour is said to be justified, that is, his person or character
vindicated or defended from the reproaches that were
cast on him; as it is said, <i>Wisdom is justified of her children</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Matt. xi. 19. Luke vii. 35. Also we frequently read of the
justification of the actions or conduct of persons, in scripture;
in which sense their own works may be said to justify or vindicate
them from the charge of hypocrisy or unregeneracy.
Again, to justify is sometimes taken, in scripture, for using endeavours
to turn many to righteousness: and therefore our
translators have rendered the words, in the prophecy of Daniel,
which signify, <i>they who justify many, they who turn many to
righteousness, shall shine as the stars</i>, Dan. xii. 3.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There are various other senses which are given of this word,
which we pass over as not applicable to the doctrine we are
maintaining, and therefore shall proceed to consider the sense
in which it is used, when importing a sinner’s justification in
the sight of God; wherein it is to be taken only in a forensick
sense, and accordingly signifies a person’s being acquitted or
discharged from guilt, or a liableness to condemnation, in such
a way as is done in courts of judicature: thus we read in the
judicial law, that <i>if there be a controversy between men, and
they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them, then
they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked</i>, Deut.
xxv. 1. where <i>to justify the righteous</i>, is to be understood for
acquitting or discharging one that appears to be righteous, or
not guilty, from condemnation; whereas <i>the wicked</i>, that is,
they who appear to be guilty, are to be <i>condemned</i>: and in this
sense the word is used, when applied to the doctrine of justification,
in the New Testament, and particularly in Paul’s epistles;
who largely insists on this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we may understand how a sinner may expect to
be discharged at God’s tribunal, let us consider the methods of
proceeding used in human courts of judicature: herein, it is
supposed, that there is a law that forbids some actions which
are deemed criminal; and also, that a punishment is annexed
to this law, which renders the person that violated it, guilty;
and then persons are supposed to be charged with the violation
thereof; which charge, if it be not made good, they are
said to be justified, that is, cleared from presumptive, not real
guilt: but if the charge be made good, and he that fell under
it, liable to punishment; if he suffer the punishment he is justified,
as in crimes that are not of a capital nature; or if he be
any otherwise cleared from the charge, so that his guilt be removed,
then he is deemed a justified person: and so the law
has nothing to lay to his charge, with respect to that which he
was before accused of. Thus when a sinner, who had been
charged with the violation of the divine law, found guilty before
God, and exposed to a sentence of condemnation, is freed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>from it, then he is said to be justified; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The privileges contained in justification; which are forgiveness
of sin and a right and title to eternal life. These are
sufficiently distinguished, though never separated; so that when
we find but one of them mentioned in a particular scripture,
which treats on this subject, the other is not excluded. Forgiveness
of sin is sometimes expressed in scripture, by a not
imputing sin; and a right to life, includes in it our being made
partakers of the adoption of children, and a right to the inheritance
prepared for them. The apostle mentions both these together,
when he speaks of our having <i>redemption through the
blood of Christ, even the forgiveness of sins</i>; and being <i>made
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light</i>,
Col. i. 12, 14. And elsewhere he speaks of Christ’s <i>redeeming
them that were under the law</i>; which includes the former branch
of justification, and of their <i>receiving the adoption of children</i>,
which includes the latter. And again he considers a justified
person as <i>having peace with God</i>, which more especially respects
pardon of sin, and of their <i>having access to the grace
wherein they stand</i>, and their <i>rejoicing in hope of the glory of
God</i>, Rom. v. 1, 2. which is what we are to understand by, or
includes in it, their right to life.</p>

<p class='c006'>That justification consists of both these branches, we maintain
against the Papists, who suppose that it includes nothing
else but forgiveness of sin, which is founded on the blood of
Christ; whereas, according to them, our right to life depends
on our internal qualifications, or sincere obedience. And besides
these, there are some Protestant divines, who suppose
that it consists only in pardon of sin; and this is asserted, by
them, with different views; some do it as most consistent with
the doctrine of justification by works, which they plead for;
whereas, others do it as being most agreeable to another notion
which they advance, namely, that we are justified only by
Christ’s passive obedience; which will be considered under a
following head. Again, there are others, whose sentiments of
the doctrine of justification are agreeable to scripture, who
maintain, that it includes both forgiveness of sins, and a right
to life; but yet they add, that the former is founded on Christ’s
passive obedience, and the latter on his active: whereas, we cannot
but think, that the whole of Christ’s obedience, both active
and passive, is the foundation of each of these; which will
also be considered, when we come to speak concerning the procuring
cause of our justification.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that we shall observe at present, is, that these two privileges
are inseparably connected; therefore, as no one can
have a right to life, but he whose sins are pardoned; so no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>one can obtain forgiveness of sin, but he must, as the consequence
hereof, have a right to life. As by the fall, man first
became guilty, and then lost that right to life which was promised
in case he had stood; so it is agreeable to the divine
perfections, provided the guilt be removed, that he should be
put in the same state as though it had not been contracted,
and consequently, that he should not only have forgiveness of
sins, but a right to life. Forgiveness of sin, without a right to
eternal life, would render our justification incomplete; therefore,
when any one is pardoned by an act of grace, he is put in
possession of that which, by his rebellion, he had forfeited, he
is considered, not only as released out of prison, but as one who
has the privileges of a subject, such as those which he had before
he committed the crime. Without this he would be like
Absalom, when, upon Joab’s intercession with David, the guilt
of murder, which he had contracted, was remitted so far, as
that he had liberty to return from Geshur, whither he was fled:
nevertheless, he reckons himself not fully discharged from the
guilt he had contracted, and concludes his return to Jerusalem,
as it were, an insignificant privilege; unless, by being admitted
to see the king’s face, and enjoy the privileges which he was
possessed of before, he might be dealt with as one who was
taken into favour, as well as forgiven, 2 Sam. xiv. 2. which
was accordingly granted. This leads us to consider these two
branches of justification in particular. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Forgiveness of sin. Sin is sometimes represented as containing
in it moral impurity, as opposed to holiness of heart and
life; and accordingly is said, <i>to defile a man</i>, Matt. xv. 19,
20. and is set forth by several metaphorical expressions in
scripture, which tend to beget an abhorrence of it as of things
impure; in which sense it is removed in sanctification rather,
than in justification; not but that divines sometimes speak of
Christ’s redeeming us from the filth and dominion of sin, and
our deliverance from it in justification: but these are to be
understood as rendering us guilty; inasmuch as all moral pollutions
are criminal, as contrary to the law of God; otherwise
our deliverance from them would not be a branch of justification;
and therefore, in speaking to this head, we shall consider
sin as that which renders men guilty before God, and so
shew what we are to understand by guilt.</p>

<p class='c006'>This supposes a person to be under a law, and to have violated
it; accordingly sin is described as the <i>transgression of the
law</i>, 1 John iii. 4. The law of God, in common with all other
laws, is primarily designed to be the rule of obedience; and
in order thereunto, it is a declaration of the divine will, which,
as creatures and subjects, we are under a natural obligation to
comply with; and God, as a God of infinite holiness and sovereignty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>cannot but signify his displeasure in case of disobedience;
and therefore he has annexed a threatening to his law,
or past a condemning sentence, as that which is due for every
transgression: this divines sometimes call the sanction of the
law, or a fence, with which it is guarded, that so, through the
corruption of our nature, we may not conclude, that we may rebel
against him with impunity: this the scripture styles, <i>The
curse of the law</i>, Gal. iii. 10. So that guilt is a liableness to
the curse or condemning sentence of the law, for our violation
of it: this is sometimes called a debt of punishment, which we
owe to the justice of God, for not paying that debt of obedience
which was due from us to his law. Thus, when our Saviour
advises us to pray, that our sins may be forgiven; he expresses
it by <i>forgiving us our debts</i>, Luke xi. 4. Matt. vi. 12. so that
forgiveness, as it is a freeing us from guilt, discharges us from
the guilt of punishment which we were liable to.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a twofold debt which man owes to God; one he
owes to him as a creature under a law; this is that debt of
obedience, which he cannot be discharged from; and therefore,
a justified person is, in this sense, as much a debtor as
any other. There is also a debt which man contracts as a criminal,
whereby he is liable to suffer punishment; this alone is
removed in justification.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we must carefully distinguish between the demerit
of sin, or its desert of punishment; and the sinner’s obligation
to suffer punishment for it. The former of these is inseparable
from sin, and not removed, or, in the least lessened,
by pardoning mercy; for sin is no less the object of the divine
detestation; nor is its intrinsic evil, or demerit, abated by its
being forgiven; and therefore, a justified person, remaining still
a sinner, as transgressing the law of God, has as much reason
to condemn himself, in this respect, as though he had not been
forgiven. The Psalmist speaking concerning a person that is
actually forgiven or justified, says, notwithstanding, that <i>if thou
Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</i> Psal.
cxxx. 3. He was, at the same time, in a justified state; but
yet he concludes, that there is a demerit of punishment in every
sin that he committed; though, when it is pardoned, the
obligation to suffer punishment is taken away:<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and therefore,
the apostle speaking of such, says, <i>There is no condemnation
to them</i>, Rom. viii. 1. We must farther distinguish between
our having matter of condemnation in us; this a justified person
has; and there being no condemnation to us; that is, the
immediate result of being pardoned.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>There are several expressions in scripture, whereby forgiveness
is set forth, namely, God’s covering sin: thus the Psalmist
says, <i>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose
sin is covered</i>, Psal. xxxii. 1. or, his hiding his face from it,
and blotting it out; or, <i>when it is sought for</i>, Psal. li. 9. its
<i>not being found</i>, Jer. l. 20. and, <i>casting our sins into the depths
of the sea</i>, Micah vii. 19. And elsewhere it is said, That when
God had pardoned the sins of his people, <i>he did not behold iniquity
in Jacob, nor see perverseness in Israel</i>, Numb, xxiii. 21.
which amounts to the same thing as the foregoing expressions
of its being covered, hid, blotted out, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible there have been many contests about the sense
of this scripture; which might, without much difficulty, have
been compromised, had the contending parties been desirous to
know each others sense, without prejudice or partiality. It is
not to be thought, that when God forgives sin, he does not
know, or suppose that the person forgiven, had, before this,
contracted guilt by sins committed; for without this, he could
not be the object of forgiveness. When God is said not to look
upon, or hide his face from their sins, it is not to be supposed,
that he knows not what they have done, or what iniquities
they daily commit against him; for that would be subversive
of his omniscience: and when he is said not to mark our iniquities,
we are not to understand it, as though he did not look
upon the sins we commit, though in a justified state, with abhorrence;
for the sinner may be pardoned, and yet the crime
forgiven be detested. But God’s not seeing sin in his people,
is to be taken in a forensic sense; and accordingly, when an
atonement is made for sin, and the guilt thereof taken away,
the criminal, in the eye of the law, is as though he had not
sinned; he is as fully discharged from the indictment, that
was brought in against him, as though he had been innocent, not
liable to any charge founded upon it; and therefore the apostle
says, <i>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?
It is God that justifieth</i>, Rom. viii. 33. and it is the same, as
for God <i>not to enter into judgment</i>, as the Psalmist elsewhere
expresses it; or to <i>punish us less than our iniquities have deserved</i>,
Psal. cxliii. 2. In this sense the indictment that was
brought against him, is cancelled, the sentence reversed, and
prosecution stopped; so that whatever evils are endured as the
consequence of sin, or with a design to humble him for it, as
bringing sin to his remembrance, with all its aggravating circumstances,
he is, nevertheless, encouraged to hope, that these
are not inflicted in a judicial way, by the vindictive justice of
God demanding satisfaction; but to display and set forth the
holiness of his nature, as infinitely opposite to all sin, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>dispensations of his providence agreeably thereunto; and that
with a design to bring him to repentance for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, that this privilege may appear to be most conducive to
our happiness and comfort, let it be considered; that wherever
God forgives sin, he forgives all sin, cancels every debt that
rendered him liable to punishment, otherwise our condition
would be very miserable, and our salvation impossible; our
condition would be like that of a person who has several indictments
brought in against him, every one of which contain
an intimation that his life is forfeited; it would avail him very
little for one indictment to be superseded, and the sentence
due to him for the others, executed: thus the apostle speaks
of the <i>free gift</i>, being <i>of many</i>, that is, of the multitude of our
<i>offences unto justification</i>, Rom. v. 16. And elsewhere he
speaks of God’s forgiving his people <i>all trespasses</i>, Col. ii. 13.
And as he forgives all past sins, so he gives them ground to
conclude, that iniquity shall not be their ruin; and therefore,
the same grace that now abounds towards them herein, together
with the virtue of the atonement made for sin, shall prevent
future crimes being charged upon them to their condemnation.
Thus concerning forgiveness of sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The other privilege, which they who are justified are
made partakers of, is the acceptation of their persons, as righteous
in the sight of God: thus they are said to be <i>made accepted
in the Beloved</i>, Eph. i. 6. and as their persons are accepted,
so are their performances, notwithstanding the many defects
that adhere to them. Thus God is said to have <i>had respect
unto Abel, and to his offering</i>, Gen. iv. 4. And, together with
this, they have a right and title to eternal life; which is that
inheritance which Christ has purchased for, and God, in his
covenant of grace, has promised to them. This is a very comprehensive
blessing; for it contains in it a right to all those
great and precious promises, which God has made, respecting
their happiness both here and hereafter. But since we shall
have occasion to insist on this in a following answer, under the
head of adoption, which some divines, not without good reason,
conclude to be a branch of justification, or, at least, to
contain in it those positive privileges, which they, who are justified,
partake of, either here of hereafter, we shall proceed to
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What is the foundation of our justification; and that
must be either some righteousness wrought out by us; or for
us. Since justification is a person’s being <i>made righteous</i>, as
the apostle styles it, Rom. v. 29. we must consider what we
are to understand hereby; and accordingly a person is said to
be righteous who never violated the law of God, nor exposed
himself to the condemning sentence thereof: in this respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>man, while in a state of innocency, was righteous; his perfect
obedience was the righteousness which, according to the tenor
of the covenant he was under, gave him a right to eternal life;
especially it would have done so, had it been persisted in, till
he was possessed of that life; but such a righteousness as this,
cannot be the foundation of our justification, as the apostle
says, <i>By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified</i>, Gal. ii.
16. Therefore, the righteousness we are now speaking of,
must be something wrought out for us, by one who stood in
our room and stead, and was able to pay that debt of obedience,
and endure those sufferings that were due for sin, which the
law of God might have exacted of us, and insisted on the payment
of, in our own persons, which, when paid by Christ for
us, is that, (as will be considered under a following head,)
which we generally call Christ’s righteousness, or what he did
and suffered in our stead, in conformity to the law of God;
whereby its honour was secured and vindicated, and justice
satisfied; so that God hereby appears to be, as the apostle
says, <i>Just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus</i>,
Rom. iii. 26.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>IV. We are now to consider the utter inability of fallen
man to perform any righteousness that can be the matter of his
justification in the sight of God; whereby it will appear, as it
is observed in this answer, that we are not accounted righteous
in his sight, for any thing wrought in us, or done by us.
That we cannot be justified by suffering the punishment that
was due for sin, appears from the infinite evil thereof; and the
eternal duration of the punishment that it deserves; as our Saviour
observes in the parable concerning the debtor, who did
not <i>agree with his adversary while in the way</i>, but was <i>delivered
to the officer</i>, and <i>cast into prison</i>; from whence he was not
to come out <i>till he had paid the uttermost farthing</i>, Matt. v.
25, 26. that is to say, he shall never be discharged. A criminal
who is sentenced to endure some punishments short of
death, or which are to continue but for a term of years, when
he has suffered them, is, upon the account hereof, discharged,
or justified: but it is far otherwise with man, when fallen into
the hands of the vindictive justice of God; therefore the Psalmist
says, <i>enter not into judgment with thy servant</i>, or do not
punish me according to the demerit of sin; <i>for in thy sight
shall no flesh living be justified</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither can any one be justified by performing active obedience
to the law of God; for nothing is sufficient to answer
that end, but what is perfect in all respects; it must be sinless
obedience, and that not only as to what concerns the time to
come, but as respecting the time past; and that is impossible,
from the nature of the thing, to be said of a sinner; for it
implies a contradiction in terms. This farther appears from
the holiness of God, which cannot but detest the least defect;
and therefore will not deal with a sinful creature, as though
he had been innocent: and as for sins that are past, they render
us equally liable to a debt of punishment, with those which
are committed at present, or shall be hereafter, in the sight of
God. Moreover, the honour of the law cannot be secured,
unless it be perfectly fulfilled; which cannot be done if there
be any defect of obedience.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those works which are done by us, without the assistance
of the Spirit of God, these proceed from a wrong principle,
and have many other blemishes attending them, upon
the account whereof, they have only a partial goodness; and
for that reason Augustine gives them no better a character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>than shining sins<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a>: but whatever terms we give them, they are
certainly very far from coming up to a conformity to the divine
law. And as for those good works which are said to be
wrought in us, and are the effect of the power and grace of
God, and the consequence of our being regenerated and converted,
these fall far short of perfection; there is a great deal
of sin attending them, which, if God should mark, none could
stand. This is expressed by Job, in a very humble manner;
<i>How should man be just with God? if he will contend with him,
he cannot answer him one of a thousand</i>. And, <i>if I wash myself
with snow water, and make my hands never so clean, yet
shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall
abhor me: for he is not a man as I am, that I should answer
him, and we should come together in judgment</i>, Job ix. 2, 3,
30-32. when God is said to <i>work in us that which is well
pleasing in his sight</i>, Heb. xiii. 21. we are not to understand,
that the grace which he works in us, renders us accepted in
his sight, in a forensic sense, or, that it justifies us; for in this
respect we are only <i>made accepted in the Beloved</i>, that is, in
Christ, Eph. i. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as what is wrought in us, has many defects attending
it; so it is not from ourselves, and therefore cannot be
accepted as a payment of that debt of obedience which we owe
to the justice of God; and consequently we cannot be justified
thereby. Some, indeed, make the terms of acceptance, or justification
in the sight of God, so very low, as though nothing
were demanded of us but our sincere endeavours to yield obedience,
whatever imperfections it be chargeable with. And
others pretend, that our confessing our sins will be conducive
hereunto; and assert, that our tears are sufficient to wash away
the guilt of sin. The Papists add, that some penances, of acts
of self-denial, will satisfy his justice, and procure a pardon for
us; yea, they go farther than this, and maintain, that persons
may perform works of supererogation, or pay more than the
debt that is owing from them, or than what the law of God requires,
and thereby not only satisfy his justice, but render him
a debtor to them; and putting them into a capacity of transferring
these arrears of debt, to those that stand in need of
them, and thereby lay an obligation on them, in gratitude, to
pay them honours next to divine. Such absurdities do men
run into, who plead for human satisfactions, and the merit of
good works, as the matter of our justification: and, indeed,
there is nothing can tend more to depreciate Christ’s satisfaction,
on the one hand, and stupify the conscience on the other;
and therefore, it is so far from being an expedient for justification,
that it is destructive to the souls of men.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>As for our sincere endeavours, or imperfect obedience, these
cannot be placed by the justice of God, in the room of perfect;
for that is contrary to the nature of justice: We cannot suppose,
that he who pays a pepper-corn, or a few mites, instead
of a large sum, really pays the debt that was due from him;
justice cannot account this to be a payment; therefore, a discharge
from condemnation, upon these terms, cannot be styled
a justification. And if it be said that it is esteemed so by an
act of grace: this is to advance the glory of one divine perfection,
and, at the same time, detract from that of another; nothing
therefore can be our righteousness, but that which the
justice of God may, in honour, accept of for our justification:
and our own righteousness is so small and inconsiderable a
thing, that it is a dishonour for him to accept of it in this respect;
and therefore we cannot be justified by works done by
us, or wrought in us.</p>

<p class='c006'>This will farther appear, if we consider the properties of
this righteousness; and in particular, that it must not only be
perfect, and therefore, such as a sinful creature cannot perform;
but it must also be of infinite value, otherwise it could
not give satisfaction to the infinite justice of God; and consequently
cannot be performed by any other than a divine person.
And it must also bear some resemblance to that debt
which was due from us, inasmuch as it was designed to satisfy
for the debt which he had contracted; and therefore must
be performed by one who is really man. But this having been
insisted on elsewhere, under the head of Christ’s Priestly office<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>,
we shall not farther enlarge on it; but proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. That our Lord Jesus Christ has wrought out this righteousness
for us, as our Surety, by performing active and passive
obedience; which is imputed to us for our justification.
We have before considered that it is impossible that such a
righteousness, as is sufficient to be the matter of our justification,
should be wrought out by us in our own persons; it therefore
follows; that it must be wrought out for us, by one who
bears the character of a surety, and performs every thing that
is necessary to our justification; such an one is our Lord Jesus
Christ. In considering this head, we must,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Shew what we are to understand by a <i>surety</i>, since it is
the righteousness of Christ, under this relation to us, which is
the matter of our justification. A surety is one who submits
to be charged with, and undertakes to pay a debt contracted by
another, to the end that the debtor may hereby be discharged:
thus the apostle Paul engages to be surety to Philemon, for
Onesimus, who had fled from him, whom he had wronged or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>injured, and was hereby indebted to him; concerning whom,
he says, <i>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that
on mine account; I, Paul, have written it with mine own hand,
I will repay it</i>, Philem. ver. 18. And elsewhere, we read of
Judah’s overture to be surety for his brother Benjamin, that he
should return to his father, as a motive to induce him to give
his consent that he should go with him into Egypt: <i>I will be
surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring
him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
blame for ever</i>, Gen. xliii. 9. This is so commonly known in
civil transactions of the like nature, between man and man, that
it needs no farther explication; however, it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That a person’s becoming surety for another, must be
a free and voluntary act: for to force any one to bind himself
to pay a debt, which he has not contracted, is as much an act
of injustice, as it is in any other instance to exact a debt where
it is not due.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) He that engages to be surety for another must be in a
capacity to pay the debt, otherwise he is unjust to the creditor,
as well as brings ruin upon himself: therefore it is said, <i>Be
not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties
for debts, if thou hast nothing to pay; why should he take
away the bed from under thee?</i> Prov. xxiii. 26, 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) He who engages to be surety for another, is supposed
not to have contracted the debt himself; and therefore the
creditor must have no demands upon him, as being involved
together with the debtor, and so becoming engaged antecedent
to his being surety: nevertheless, he is deemed, in the eye of
the law, consequent thereunto, to stand in the debtor’s room,
and to be charged with his debt, and equally obliged to the
payment thereof, as though he had contracted it, especially if
the creditor be resolved to exact the payment of him, rather
than of the original debtor<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) As debts are of different kinds, so the obligation of a surety
agreeably thereunto admits of different circumstances: thus
there are pecuniary debts resulting from those dealings or contracts
which pass between man and man in civil affairs; and there
are debts of service or obedience; as also debts of punishment,
as has been before observed, for crimes committed; in all
which cases, as the nature of the debt differs, so there are some
things peculiar in the nature of suretyship for it. In pecuniary
debts the creditor is obliged to accept of payment at the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of any one, who at the request of the debtor is willing to discharge
the debt which he has contracted, especially, if what he
pays be his own; but in debts of service or punishment, when
the surety offers himself to perform of suffer what was due
from another, the creditor is at his liberty to accept of, or refuse
satisfaction from him, but might insist on the payment of
the debt by him in his own person, from whom it was due.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Christ was such a surety for us, or substituted in our
room, with a design to pay the debt which was due to the justice
of God from us. Here, that we may assume the ideas of
a surety but now-mentioned, and apply them to Christ, as our
surety, let it be considered;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That what he did and suffered for us was free and voluntary;
this appears from his readiness to engage therein, expressed
by his saying, <i>Lo, I come to do thy will</i>, Heb. x. 9.
And therefore whatever he suffered for us did not infer the least
injustice in God that inflicted it<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) He was able to pay the debt, so that there was not the
least injury offered to the justice of God by his undertaking.
This is evident, from his being God incarnate; and therefore
in one nature he was able to do and suffer whatever was demanded
of us, and in the other nature to add an infinite value
to what he performed therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) He was not rendered incapable of paying our debt, or
answering for the guilt which we had contracted by any debt
of his own, which involved him in the same guilt, and rendered
him liable to the same punishment with us, as is evident
from what the prophet says concerning him, who speaks of
him, as charged with our guilt, though <i>he had done no violence,
neither was any deceit found in his mouth</i>, Isa. liii. 9. That
which the prophet calls <i>doing no violence</i>, the apostle Peter referring
to, and explaining it, styles <i>doing</i>, or committing <i>no sin</i>
of any kind. He was not involved in the guilt of Adam’s sin,
which would have rendered him incapable of being a surety
to pay that debt for us; neither had he the least degree of the
corruption of nature, being conceived in an extraordinary way,
and sanctified from the womb<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a>. Nor did he ever commit actual
sin, for he was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Another thing observed in the character of a surety,
which is very agreeable to Christ, is; that what he engaged to
pay was his own, or at his own disposal, he did not offer any
injury to justice, by paying a debt that was before due to it,
or by performing any service which he had no warrant to do.
It is true, he gave his life a ransom, but consider him as a divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Person, and he had an undoubted right to dispose or of,
lay down that life which he had as man. Did he consent, in
the eternal transaction between the Father and him, to be incarnate,
and in our nature to perform the work of a Surety?
this was an act of his sovereign will; and therefore whatever
he paid as a ransom for us, was, in the highest sense, his own.
The case was not the same as though one man should offer to
lay down his life for another, who has no power to dispose of
his life at pleasure. We are not lords of our own lives; as
we do not come into the world by our own wills, we are not
to go out of it when we please; but Christ was as God, if I
may so express myself, lord of himself, of all that he did and
suffered as man; by which I understand that he had a right as
God to consent or determine to do, and suffer whatever he did
and suffered as man; therefore the debt which he paid in the
human nature was his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) As it has been before observed, that in some cases he
that is willing to substitute himself as a surety in the room of
the debtor, must be accepted, and approved by him to whom
it was due; and in this respect our Saviour’s substitution as
our surety in our room, had a sanction from God the Father;
who gave many undeniable evidences that what he did and suffered
for us, was accepted by him as really as though it had
been done by us in our own persons, which, as was before observed,
might have been refused by him, it being the payment
of a debt of obedience and sufferings. Now that God the Father
testified his acceptance of Christ as our surety, appears,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. From his well-pleasedness with him, both before and after
his incarnation; before he came into the world, God seems
to speak with pleasure in the fore-thought of what he would be,
and do, as Mediator, when he says, <i>Behold my servant whom
I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth</i>, Isa. xlii. 1.
And he is also said to be <i>well pleased for his righteousness sake</i>,
ver. 21. or in his determining before hand that he should, as
Mediator, bring in that righteousness which would tend to
magnify the law, and make it honourable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, his having anointed him by a previous designation
to this work, as the prophet intimates, speaking of him before
his incarnation, Isa. lxi. 1, 2. is certainly an evidence of
his being approved to be our surety. And when he was incarnate,
God approved of him, when engaged in the work
which he came into the world about: thus, when he was solemnly
set apart, by baptism to the discharge of his public ministry,
we read of a voice from heaven, saying, <i>This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased</i>, Matt. iii. 17. And to
this we may add, that there was the most undeniable proof of
God’s well pleasedness with him, as having accomplished this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>work, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his
own right hand, in heavenly places.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This may be farther argued from his justifying and saving
those for whom he undertook to be a surety, before the debt
was actually paid; and his applying the same blessings to his
people, since the work of redemption was finished. The application
of what Christ undertook to purchase, is an evidence
of the acceptableness of the price. And this may be considered,
either as respecting those that were saved before his incarnation
and death; or those who are, from that time, in all
succeeding ages, made partakers of the saving benefits procured
thereby. Before the actual accomplishment of what he undertook
to do and suffer, as our surety, God the Father trusted
him, and, by virtue of his promising to pay the debt, discharged
the Old Testament saints from condemnation, as effectually
as though it had been actually paid. There are some
cases in which a surety’s undertaking to pay a debt, is reckoned
equivalent to the actual payment of it; namely, when it is
impossible that he should make a failure in the payment thereof,
either though mutability, or a fickelness of temper, inducing
him to change his purpose; or from unfaithfulness, which
might render him regardless of his engagement to pay it: or
from some change in his circumstances whereby, though he
once was able to pay it, he afterwards becomes unable: I say,
if none of these things can take place, and especially, if the
creditor, by not demanding present payment, receives some
advantage, which is an argument that he does not stand in need
thereof: in these cases the promise to pay a debt is equivalent
to the payment of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now these things may well be applied to Christ’s undertaking
to pay our debt: it was impossible that he should fail in
the accomplishment of what he had undertaken; or change his
purpose, and so, though he designed to do it, enter into other
measures; or, though he had promised to do it, be unfaithful
in the accomplishment thereof, these things being all inconsistent
with the character of his person who undertook it; and,
though he suffered for us in the human nature, it was his divine
nature that undertook to do it therein, which is infinitely
free from the least imputation of weakness, mutability, or unfaithfulness:
and, whereas the present payment was not immediately
demanded, nor designed to be made till the fulness
of time was come, his forbearance hereof was compensated by
that revenue of glory which accrued to the divine name, and
that honour that redounded to the Mediator, by the salvation
of the elect, before his incarnation; and this was certainly an
undeniable evidence of God’s approving his undertaking.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>And since the work of redemption has been completed, all
those who are, or shall be brought to glory, have, in themselves,
a convincing proof of God’s being well pleased with
Christ, as substituted in their room and stead, to pay the debt
that was due from them to his justice, as the foundation of
their justification. From hence it plainly appears, that Christ
was substituted as a surety in our room and stead, to do that
for us which was necessary for our justification; and we have
sufficient ground to conclude, that he was so from scripture,
from whence alone it can be proved, it being a matter of pure
revelation. Thus he is said, in express terms, to have been
<i>made a surety of a better testament</i>, Heb. vii. 22. and that as
our surety, he has paid that debt of sufferings which was due
from us, is evident, in that he is said to <i>offer himself a sacrifice
for our sins</i>, ver. 27. and to have been <i>once offered to bear
the sins of many</i>, chap. ix. 28. and from his being holy, harmless,
undefiled, and separate from sinners, the apostle argues,
that he had no occasion to offer a sacrifice for himself, or that
he had no sin of his own to be charged with, therefore, herein
he bore or answered for our sins: thus the apostle Peter says,
<i>He bare our sins in his own body, on the tree, by whose stripes
we are healed</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 24. And elsewhere, we read of <i>his
being made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him</i>, 2 Cor. v. 21. that is, he, who
had no guilt of his own to answer for, submitted to be charged
with our guilt, to stand in our room and stead, and accordingly
to be made a sacrifice for sin; all this implies as much as
his being made a surety for us. But this having been particularly
insisted on elsewhere in speaking concerning Christ’s
satisfaction, which could not be explained without taking occasion
to mention his being substituted in the room and stead
of those for whom he paid a price of redemption; and, having
also considered the meaning of those scriptures that speak of
his bearing our sins, we shall proceed to consider<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a>,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. What Christ did, pursuant to this character, namely, as
our surety, as he paid all that debt which the justice of God
demanded from us, which consisted in active and passive obedience.
There was a debt of active obedience demanded from
man as a creature; and upon his failure of paying it, when he
sinned, it became an out-standing debt, due from us; but such
as could never be paid by us. God determines not to justify
any, unless this out-standing debt be paid; Christ, as our surety,
engages to take the payment of it on himself: and, whereas
this defect of obedience, together with all actual transgressions,
which proceeded from the corruption of our nature, render us
guilty or liable to the stroke of vindictive justice, Christ, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>our surety, undertakes to bear that also: this we generally call
the imputation of our sin to Christ, the placing our debt to his
account, and the transferring the debt of punishment, which
was due from us to him, upon which account he is said to yield
obedience, and suffer in our room and stead, or to perform
active and passive obedience for us; which two ideas the
apostle joins in one expression, when he says, that he <i>became
obedient unto death</i>, Phil. ii. 8. But this having been been insisted
on elsewhere, under the head of Christ’s satisfaction<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>,
where we shewed, not only that Christ performed active as
well as passive obedience for us, but endeavoured to answer
the objections that are generally brought against Christ’s active
obedience, being part of that debt which he engaged to pay for
us; we shall pass it by at present.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which may farther be added, to prove that our sin
and guilt were imputed to him, may be argued from his being
said to be <i>made a curse for us</i>, in order to his redeeming us
from the curse of the law, Gal. iii. 13. and also from his <i>being
made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of
God in him</i>, 2 Cor. v. 21. And also from other scriptures,
that speak of him as suffering, though innocent; punished for
sin, though he was at the same time the Lamb of God, without
spot or blemish; dealt with as guilty, though he had never
contracted any guilt, and being made a sacrifice for sin, though
sinless, which could not have been done consistently with the
justice of God, had not our sins been placed to his account, or
imputed to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is indeed a very difficult thing to convince some persons,
how Christ could be charged with sin, or have sin imputed to
him, in consistency with the sinless purity of his nature, which
some think to be no better than a contradiction, though it be
agreeable to the scripture mode of speaking, <i>viz.</i> <i>He was made
sin for us</i>, and yet <i>knew no sin</i>, 2 Cor. v. 21. However, when
we speak of sin’s being imputed to him, we are far from insinuating,
that he committed any acts of sin; or, that his human
nature was, in the least, inclined to, or defiled thereby;
we choose therefore to use the scripture phrase, in which he is
said to have <i>borne our sins</i>, rather than to say, that he was a
sinner; much less would I give countenance to that expression
which some make use of, that he was the greatest sinner
in the world; since I do not desire to apply a word to him,
which is often taken in a sense not in the least applicable to the
holy Jesus. We cannot be too cautious in our expressions,
lest the most common sense in which we understand the greatest
sinner, when applied to men, should give any one a wrong
idea of him, as though he had committed, or were defiled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>sin. All that we assert is, that he was charged with our sins,
when he suffered for them, not with having committed them;
but with the guilt of them, which, by his own consent, was imputed
to him; otherwise his sufferings could not have been a
punishment for sin; and if they had not been so, our sin could
not have been expiated, nor would his sufferings have been the
ground of our justification. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The reference that Christ’s suretyship-righteousness has
to our justification. This is generally styled its being imputed;
which is a word very much used by those who plead for the
scripture-sense of the doctrine of justification, and as much opposed
by them that deny it; and we are obliged to defend the
use of it; otherwise Christ’s righteousness, how glorious soever
it be in itself, would not avail for our justification. Here
it is necessary for us to explain what we mean by the imputation
of Christ’s righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are some who oppose this doctrine, by calling it a putative
righteousness, the shadow or appearance of that which
has in it no reality, or our being accounted what we are not,
whereby a wrong judgment is passed on persons and things.
However, we are not to deny it because it is thus misrepresented,
and thereby unfairly opposed: it is certain, that there
are such words used in scripture, and often applied to this
doctrine, which, without any ambiguity or strain on the sense
thereof, may be translated, to reckon, to account, or to place
a thing done by another to our account; or, as we express
it, to impute.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> And that, either respects what is done by
us; or something done by another for us. The former of these
senses our adversaries do not oppose; as when it is said, that
Phinehas <i>executed judgment, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness</i>, Psal. cvi. 31. that is, it was approved by God as
a righteous action; which expression seems to obviate an objection
that some might make against it; supposing, that Phinehas
herein did that which more properly belonged to the civil
magistrate; or, that this judicial act in him, was done without
a formal trial, and, it may be, too hastily; but God owns
the action, and, in a way of approbation, places it to his account
for righteousness, that it should be reckoned a righteous action
throughout all generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, sometimes that which is done by a person, is imputed
to him, or charged upon him, so that he must answer for
it, or suffer the punishment due to it: thus Shimei says to David,
<i>Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me</i>, 2 Sam. xix. 19.
that is, do not charge that sin, which I committed, upon me,
so as to put me to death for it, which thou mightest justly do.
And Stephen prays, <i>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge</i>, Acts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>vii. 60. impute it not to them, or inflict not the punishment on
them that it deserves. No one can deny that what is done by
a person himself, may be placed to his own account; so that
he may be rewarded or punished for it; or it may be approved
or disapproved: but this is not the sense in which we understand
it when speaking concerning the imputation of Christ’s
righteousness to us; for this supposes that which is done by another,
to be placed to our account. This is the main thing which
is denied by those who have other sentiments of the doctrine
we are maintaining; and, they pretend, that for God to account
Christ’s righteousness ours, is to take a wrong estimate of
things, to reckon that done by us which was not; which is contrary
to the wisdom of God, who can, by no means, entertain
any false ideas of things; and if the action be reckoned ours,
then the character of the person performing it, must also be
applied to us; which is to make us sharers in Christ’s Mediatorial
office and glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this is the most perverse sense which can be put on
words, or a setting this doctrine in such a light as no one takes
it in, who pleads for it: we do not suppose, that God looks
upon man with his all-seeing eye, as having done that which
Christ did, or to sustain the character which belongs to him in
doing it; we are always reckoned, by him, as offenders, or contracting
guilt, and unable to do any thing that can make an
atonement for it. Therefore, what interest soever we have in
what Christ did, it is not reputed our action; but God’s imputing
Christ’s righteousness to us, is to be taken in a forensic
sense, which is agreeable to the idea of a debt being paid by a
surety: it is not supposed that the debtor paid the debt which
the surety paid; but yet it is placed to his account, or imputed
to him as really as though he had paid it himself. Thus what
Christ did and suffered in our room and stead, is as much placed
to our account, as though we had done and suffered it ourselves;
so that by virtue hereof we are discharged from condemnation.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>This is the sense in which we understand the imputation of
Christ’s righteousness to us; and it is agreeable to the account
we have thereof in scripture: thus we are said to be <i>made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>righteousness of God in him</i>, 2 Cor. v. 21. the abstract being
put for the concrete; that is, we are denominated and dealt
with as righteous persons, acquitted and discharged from condemnation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in the virtue of what was done by him, who is elsewhere
styled, <i>The Lord our righteousness</i>; and the apostle
speaks of his <i>having Christ’s righteousness</i>, Phil. iii. 9. that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>having it imputed to him, or having an interest in it, or being
dealt with according to the tenor thereof; in this respect he opposes
it to that righteousness which was in him, as the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of his own performances: and elsewhere Christ is said to be
<i>made of God unto us righteousness</i>; that is, his fulfilling the
law is placed to our account; and the apostle speaks of <i>Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>being the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth</i>,
Rom. x. 4. which is the same with what he asserts in
other words elsewhere concerning the <i>righteousness of the law’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>being fulfilled in us</i>, chap. viii. 3, 4. who could not be justified
by our own obedience to it, in <i>that it was weak through the
flesh</i>, or by reason of our fallen state; therefore Christ did this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>for us; and accordingly God deals with us as though we had
fulfilled the law in our own persons, inasmuch as it was fulfilled
by him as our surety.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>This may farther be illustrated, by what we generally understand
by Adam’s sin being imputed to us, as one contrary
may illustrate another; therefore, as sin and death entered into
the world by the <i>offence of one</i>, to wit, the first Adam, <i>in
whom all have sinned; so by the righteousness of one the free
gift</i>, Rom. v. 18. that is, eternal life <i>came upon all men</i>, to wit,
those who shall be saved <i>unto justification of life</i>; and for this
reason the apostle speaks of Adam as the <i>figure of him that
was to come</i>, ver. 14. Now as Adam’s sin was imputed to us,
as our public head and representative, so that we are involved
in the guilt thereof, or fall in him; so Christ’s righteousness
is imputed to us, as he was our public head and surety: and
accordingly, in the eye of the law, that which was done by
him, was the same as though it had been done by us; and
therefore, as the effect and consequence hereof, we are justified
thereby. This is what we call Christ’s righteousness being
imputed to us, or placed to our account; and it is very agreeable
to the common acceptation of the word, in dealings between
man and man. When one has contracted a debt, and desires
that it may be placed to the account of his surety, who
undertakes for the payment of it, it is said to be imputed to
him; and his discharge hereupon is as valid as though the
debtor has paid it in his own person. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. To consider justification as it is an act of God’s free
grace, which is particularly insisted on in one of the answers
we are explaining; for the understanding of which, let it be
observed, that we are not to suppose, that when we are justified
by an act of grace, this is opposed to our being justified
upon the account of a full satisfaction made by our surety to
the justice of God; in which respect we consider our discharge
from condemnation, as an act of justice. The debtor is, indeed,
beholden to the grace of God for this privilege, but the surety
that paid the debt, had not the least abatement thereof made,
but was obliged to glorify the justice of God to the utmost,
which accordingly he did. However, there are several things
in which the grace of God is eminently displayed, more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In that God should be willing to accept of satisfaction
from the hands of our surety, which he might have demanded
of us. This appears from what has been before observed, namely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>that the debt which we had contracted was not of the same
nature with pecuniary debts, in which case the creditor is obliged
to accept of payment, though the overture hereof be made
by another, and not by him that contracted the debt: whereas
the case is different in debts of obedience to be performed, or
punishment to be endured; in which instances, he, to whom
satisfaction is to be given, must accept of one to be substituted
in the room of him from whom the obedience or sufferings
were originally due; otherwise, the overture made, or what is
done and suffered by him, pursuant thereunto, is not regarded,
or available to procure a discharge for him, in whose room he
substituted himself. God might have exacted the debt of us, in
our own persons, and then our condition had been equally miserable
with that of fallen angels, for whom no mediator was accepted,
no more than provided.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The grace of God farther appears, in that he provided a
surety for us, which we could not have done for ourselves; nor
have engaged him to perform this work for us, who was the
only person that could bring about the great work of redemption.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only creatures who are capable of performing perfect
obedience, are the holy angels; but these could not do it, for,
as has been before observed, whoever performs it must be incarnate,
that they may be capable of paying the debt, in some
respects, in kind, which was due from us; therefore they must
suffer death, and consequently have a nature which is capable
of dying; but this the angels had not, nor could have, but by
the divine will.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, if God should have dispensed with that part of satisfaction,
which consists in a subjection to death, and have declared,
that active obedience should be sufficient to procure our
justification; the angels, though capable of performing active
obedience, would, notwithstanding, have been defective therein;
so that justice could not, in honour, have accepted of it, any
more than it could have dispensed with the obligation to perform
obedience in general; because it would not have been of
infinite value; and it is the value of things that justice regards,
and not barely the matter of perfection thereof in other respects:
so that it must be an obedience that had in it something
infinitely valuable, or else it could not have been accepted
by God, as a price of redemption, in order to the procuring
our justification: and this could be performed by none but our
Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious author and procurer of this
privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was impossible for man to have found out this Mediator
or Surety; so that it had its first rise from God, and not from
us; it is he that found a ransom, and laid help upon one that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>is mighty; this was the result of his will: therefore our Saviour
is represented as saying, <i>Lo I come to do thy will</i>, Heb.
x. 7. as the apostle expresses it. That we could not, by any
means, have found out this surety, or engaged him to have done
that for us which was necessary for our justification, will evidently
appear, if we consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That when man fell, the Son of God was not incarnate;
and provided we allow that fallen man had some idea of a
Trinity of persons, in the unity of the divine Essence, which
is not unreasonable to suppose; since it was necessary that that
should be revealed to him before he fell, in order to his performing
acceptable worship; yet, can any one suppose that man
could have asked such a favour of a divine person, as to take
his nature, and put himself in his room and stead, and expose
himself to the curse of that law which he had violated; this
could never have entered into his heart; yea, the very thought,
if it had taken its rise first from him, would have savoured of
more presumption than had he entreated that God would pardon
his sin without a satisfaction. But,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) If he had supposed it impossible for the Son of God to
be incarnate, or had conjectured that there had been the least
probability of his being willing to express this instance of condescending
goodness, how could he have known that God
would have accepted the payment of our debt, at the hands of
another, or have commended his love to us, who were such
enemies to him, in not sparing him, but delivering him up for
us? if God’s accepting of a satisfaction be necessary, in order
to its taking effect, as well as the perfection or infinite value
of it; it is certain, man could not have known that he would
have done it; for that was a matter of pure revelation. Moreover,</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Should we suppose even this possible, or that man might
have expected that God would have been moved to have done
it by intreaty; yet such was the corruption, perverseness, and
rebellion of his nature, as fallen; and so great was his inability
to perform any act of worship, that he could not have addressed
himself to God, in a right manner, that he would admit of a
surety; and God cannot hear any prayer but that which is put
up to him by faith, which supposes a Mediator, whose purchase
and gift it is; and therefore, since the sinful creature
could not plead with God by faith, that he would send his Son
to be a Mediator, how could he hope to obtain this blessing?
it therefore evidently follows, that as a man could not give satisfaction
for himself; so he could not find out any one that
could or would give it for him. And therefore, the grace of
God, in the provision that he has made of such a surety as his
own Son, unasked for, unthought of, as well as undeserved, is
very illustrious.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>3. It was a very great instance of grace in our Saviour, that
he was pleased to consent to perform this work for us, without
which the justice of God could not have exacted the debt of
him; and he being perfectly innocent, could not be obliged to
suffer punishment, which it would have been unjust in God to
have inflicted, had he not been willing to be charged with our
guilt, and to stand in our room and stead. And his grace herein
more eminently appears, in that though he knew before-hand
all the difficulties, sorrows, and temptations, which he was to
meet with in the discharge of this work; yet this did not discourage
him from undertaking it; neither was he unapprised
of the character of those for whom he undertook it: he knew
the rebellion, and guilt contracted thereby, that rendered this
necessary, in order to their salvation; and he knew before-hand,
that they would, notwithstanding all the engagements he might
lay on them to the contrary, discover the greatest ingratitude
towards him; and, instead of improving so great an instance
of condescending goodness, that they would neglect this great
salvation, when purchased by him, and thereby appear to be his
greatest enemies, notwithstanding this act of friendship to them,
unless he not only engaged to purchase redemption for, but
apply it to them, and work those graces in them whereby they
might be enabled to give him the glory which is due to him
for this great undertaking. And this leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. To consider the use of faith in justification, and how,
notwithstanding what has been said concerning our being justified
by Christ’s righteousness, we may, in other respects, be
said to be justified by faith; and also shew what this faith is,
whereby we are justified: which being particularly insisted on
in the two following answers, we shall proceed to consider
them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXXII., LXXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXXII. <i>What is justifying Faith?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Justifying faith is a saving grace, wrought in the heart
of a sinner, by the Spirit and word of God; whereby he,
being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability
in himself, and all other creatures, to recover him out of his
lost condition, not only assenteth to the truth of the promise
of the gospel, but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his
righteousness therein held forth, for pardon of sin, and for
the accepting and accounting of his person, righteous in the
sight of God for salvation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXXIII. <i>How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight
of God?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God; not because
of those graces which do always accompany it, or of those
good works that are the fruits of it; nor as if the grace of
faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for justification;
but only as it is an instrument, by which he receiveth
and applieth Christ and his righteousness.</p>

<p class='c012'>We choose first to speak to the latter of these two answers,
in which faith is considered as that whereby a sinner
is justified, before the former of them, inasmuch as it seems
better connected with what has been before insisted on, in explaining
the doctrine of justification. And in considering the
account we have of justifying faith, there are two things, which
may be taken notice of, in this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. It is observed, that though there are other graces which
always accompany faith and good works, that flow from it;
yet none of these are said to justify a sinner in the sight of
God.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. How faith justifies, or what it is to be justified by
faith.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>I. That though there are other graces which always accompany
faith, and good works that flow from it; yet none of these
are said to justify a sinner in the sight of God. There is an
inseparable connexion between faith, and all other graces;
which, though it be distinguished, is never separate from them.
They are all considered as <i>fruits of the Spirit</i>, Gal. v. 22, 23.
thus the apostle reckons up several other graces that are connected
with faith, and proceed from the same Spirit, such as
<i>love</i>, <i>peace</i>, <i>joy</i>, <i>long-suffering</i>, <i>gentleness</i>, <i>goodness</i>, <i>meekness</i>,
<i>temperance</i>: and the same apostle commends the church at
Thessalonica for their <i>work of faith; and</i> considers this as connected
with a <i>labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord
Jesus Christ</i>, 1 Thess. i. 3. And the apostle Peter exhorts
the church, to which he writes, to <i>add to their faith virtue, and
to virtue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance
patience, to patience godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness,
and to brotherly kindness charity</i>, 2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7. which supposes
that all these graces ought to be connected together. And
the apostle James calls it a <i>dead faith</i>, James ii. 17. which has
not other works or graces joined with it; and, indeed, these
graces are not only connected with it, but flow from it, or are
the fruits thereof: thus we read of the <i>heart’s being purified by
faith</i>, Acts xv. 9. that is, this grace, when acted in a right
manner, will have a tendency, in some degree, to purge the
soul from that moral impurity, which proceeds out of the heart
of man, and is inconsistent with saving faith: and elsewhere
we read of <i>faith as working by love</i>, Gal. v. 6. that is, exciting
those acts of love, both to God and man, which contain a
summary of practical religion. It is also said to <i>overcome the
world</i>, 1 John v. 4. and it enables Christians to do or suffer
great things for Christ’s sake, of which the apostle gives various
instances in the Old Testament saints, Heb. xi. But, notwithstanding
the connexion of other graces with faith, and
those works which flow from it, we are never said, in scripture,
to be justified thereby; not by love to God; nor by any
act of obedience to him, which can be called no other than
works: whereas, when the apostle speaks of our justification
by faith, he puts it in opposition to works, when he says, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span><i>a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law</i>, Rom.
ii. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> To this it is objected, that the apostle here speaks
concerning the ceremonial law, which he excludes from being
the matter of our justification, and not the moral law, or any
evangelical duty, such as love and sincere obedience, which,
together with faith is the matter of our justification.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That when the apostle
speaks of our justification by faith, without the deeds of the
law, he does not hereby intend the ceremonial law; for those
whom he describes as justified persons, are said to be, in a following
verse, not only Jews, but Gentiles, that were converted
to the Christian faith; the former, indeed, were under a temptation
to seek to be justified by the ceremonial law, and so to
conclude that they had a right to eternal life; because of their
being distinguished from the world, by the external privileges
of the covenant which they were under, many of which were
contained in, or signified by that law: but the Gentiles had nothing
to do with it, and therefore never expected to be justified
by the ceremonial law; accordingly, when the apostle speaks
of justification by faith without the deeds of the law, he cannot
hereby be supposed to intend the ceremonial law. And if
we look a little farther into the context, we shall find, by his
method of reasoning, that he excludes all works in general, and
opposes faith to them; for he argues, that we are justified in
such a way, as tends to exclude boasting; but he that insists
on any works performed by himself, as the matter of his justification,
cannot do this any otherwise than in a boasting way,
valuing himself, and founding his right to eternal life, upon
them. We are not therefore justified by them, but by faith;
that is, we are justified in such a way as that, while we lay
claim to the greatest privileges from Christ, we are disposed
to give him all the glory, or to renounce our own righteousness
at the same time that we have recourse to his righteousness for
justification, by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that it may farther appear, that our justification by faith,
is opposed to justification by works, either those that accompany
or flow from it, we may apply what has been before suggested,
in considering the matter of our justification to this
argument. If we consider the demands of justice, or what it
may in honour reckon a sufficient compensation for the dishonour
that has been brought to the divine name by sin, or
what may be deemed a satisfactory payment of the outstanding
debt of perfect obedience, which was due from us, or punishment,
which we were liable to, according to the sanction of the
divine law; we may easily infer, that no obedience, performed
by us, though including in it the utmost perfection, that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>fallen creature is capable of attaining, is a sufficient satisfaction;
and if there can be no justification without satisfaction,
then we cannot be justified thereby. Therefore it is a vain
thing for persons to distinguish in this case, between works
done before and after faith, as though the former only were
excluded from being the matter of our justification; or to say,
as some do, that we are not indeed justified by obedience to
the moral law, but by our obeying the precepts which our Saviour
has laid down in the gospel, such as faith, and repentance,
<i>&amp;c.</i> which they call obedience to the gospel as a new
law: but let it be considered, that these evangelical duties are
supposed to be performed as the result of a divine command,
which has the formal nature of a law, whether they be contained
in the moral law or no; therefore, when we are justified
by faith in opposition to the works of the law, this must be
opposed to obedience of any kind performed by us.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this also appears from the nature of faith, to which justification,
by the works of the law, is opposed; for faith is a
soul-humbling grace, and includes in it a renouncing of all
merit, or inducement taken from ourselves, as a reason why
God should bestow on us the blessings we stand in need of;
it trusts in Christ for righteousness, and in him alone, and
therefore turns itself from any thing that may have the least
tendency to eclipse his glory, as the only foundation of our justification:
therefore, when we are said to be justified by faith,
and not by the works of the law, the meaning is, we are justified
in such a way as tends to set the crown upon Christ’s
head, acknowledging him to be the only fountain from whence
this privilege is derived.</p>

<p class='c006'>It follows from hence that our justification cannot be founded
on our repentance; though this is often maintained by those
who are on the other side of the question, who suppose, that
justification contains in it nothing else but forgiveness of sin;
and if offences are to be forgiven by men, upon their repentance,
or confessing their fault, then forgiveness may be expected
from God, on our repentance: and some use a very unsavoury
way of speaking, when they say, that our tears have a
virtue to wash away our sins; and that they may give farther
countenance to this opinion, they refer to that scripture, in
which it is said, <i>Repent, that your sins may be blotted out</i>, Acts
iii. 19. and others of the like nature; by which we are not to
suppose, that the apostle means, that forgiveness of sin is founded
on our repentance, as the matter of our justification in the
sight of God; but that there is an inseparable connexion between
our claim to forgiveness of sin, (together with all the
fruits and effects of the death of Christ, whereby this blessing
was procured) and repentance; so that one is not to be expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>without the other; and though men are to forgive injuries
in case the offender acknowledges his fault, and makes
sufficient restitution; this they may do, inasmuch as the offence
is only committed against a creature; and especially if
the offence be of a private nature. But supposing this should
be applied to juridical and forensick cases, will any one say,
that the prince is obliged to forgive the criminal who is under
a sentence of condemnation, because he is sorry for what he
has done, or confesses his fault? Would this secure his honour
as a law-giver? And if hereupon the offender were to be discharged
from his guilt, would not this be a defect in the administration
of the legislature? How then can this be applied
to forgiveness, expected at the hand of God; in which justice,
as well as mercy, is to have the glory that is due to it; and
we are not only to be acquitted, but justified, or pronounced
guiltless, since our acknowledgment of our offence cannot be
reckoned a sufficient satisfaction to the justice of God?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected, by those on the other side of the question,
that though repentance be not in itself a sufficient compensation
to the justice of God for the crimes which we have
committed; yet God may, by an act of grace, accept of it,
as though it had been sufficient<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a>. This they illustrate by a
similitude taken from a person’s selling an estate of a considerable
value, to one who has no money to buy it, provided he
will pay a pepper-corn of acknowledgment. Thus, how insignificant
soever, repentance, or any other grace, which is deemed
the matter of our justification, be in itself, it is by an act of
favour, deemed a sufficient price.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In answer to this I would observe, that the objection,
which was before brought against the doctrine we have
been maintaining, concerning the imputation of Christ’s righteousness,
namely, that it was a putative righteousness, a not
judging of things according to truth, and the like, seems to be
of no weight when it affects their own cause; otherwise we
might turn their argument against themselves, and ask them;
whether this be for God to judge according to truth, when that
is accepted as a sufficient payment, by his justice, which is in
itself of no value? But passing this by, we may farther observe,
that this is wholly to set aside the necessity of satisfaction,
as the Socinians do; and therefore it is no wonder that
they make use of this method of reasoning. As for others who
do not altogether deny this doctrine, yet think that a small price
may be deemed satisfactory for sin committed. That which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>may be replied to it, is, that if justification, as tending to advance
the glory of divine justice, in taking away the guilt of
sin, depends upon a price paid that is equivalent to the debt
contracted; and nothing short of a price of infinite value can
be reckoned an equivalent thereunto, then certainly that which
is performed by men, cannot be deemed a sufficient payment,
or accepted of as such.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a vain thing for persons to pretend that there is a difference
between satisfying God, and satisfying his justice; or,
that to satisfy God is to pay a price, be it never so small, that
he demands; whereas, satisfying justice is paying a price equal
to the thing purchased; since we must conclude, that God cannot
deem any thing satisfactory to himself, that is not so to his
justice. Therefore, this distinction will not avail, to free their
argument from the absurdity that attends it.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here observe, that as some speak of pardon of
sin’s being founded on our repentance; others speak of our
justification as being by the act of faith, or by faith considered
as a work, and in defending justification by works, as though
it were not opposed to justification by faith (the contrary to
which has been before proved) they argue, that we are often
said, in scripture, to be justified by faith; but this faith is a
work; therefore it cannot be denied but that we are justified
by works. To which it may be replied, that it is one thing
to say, that we are justified by faith, that is, a work, and another
thing to say, that we are justified by it as a work; or, it
is one thing to say, that we are justified for our faith, and another
thing to say, that we are justified by it; which will more
evidently appear under the following head, which we proceed
to consider; namely,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. What it is for us to be justified by faith, or how faith
justifies. None can, with the least shadow of reason, deny,
that justification by faith, is a scripture-mode of speaking,
though some have questioned, whether the apostle’s words,
<i>being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ</i>, gives countenance to the doctrine of justification
by faith; for they observe, that by putting a stop immediately
after the word <i>justified</i>, the sense would be, that they
who are justified by Christ’s righteousness, have peace with
God by faith, through the Lord Jesus Christ: but though this
will a little alter the reading of the text; yet it will not overthrow
the doctrine of justification by faith, as contained therein.
For if we understand our <i>having peace with God</i>, as importing,
that peace which they have a right to, who are interested
in Christ’s righteousness, and not barely peace of conscience:
then it will follow, that to have this peace by faith, is, in effect,
the same as to be justified by faith; and this farther appears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>from the following words, <i>by whom also we have access
by faith into this grace, wherein we stand</i>. The <i>grace wherein
we stand</i>, is that grace which is the foundation of our justification,
and not barely peace of conscience: when we are
therefore said to have access by faith unto this grace, it is the
same as for us to be justified by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this is not the only place in which we are said to
be justified by faith; for the apostle says elsewhere, <i>We are
justified by the faith of Jesus Christ</i>, Gal. ii. 16. or by faith in
Jesus Christ, and again, <i>the just shall live by faith</i>, Rom. i. 17.
which, agreeably to the context, must be understood of their
being justified by faith; in which sense the apostle particularly
explains it elsewhere, Gal. iii. 11. and in another place he
speaks of <i>the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
Christ</i>, Rom. iii. 22. and also of a believer’s <i>waiting for the
hope of righteousness by faith</i>, Gal. v. 5. We must not therefore
deny that justification is by faith; but rather explain the
sense of those scriptures that establish this doctrine, agreeably
to the mind of the Holy Ghost therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are various methods taken to explain the doctrine of
justification by faith; particularly one that we think subversive
of justification by Christ’s righteousness: the other, that
which is contained in the answer which we are explaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the former of these, namely, that which is inconsistent
with the doctrine of justification by Christ’s righteousness.
This is maintained by those who plead for justification
by works; and consequently, they say, that we are justified by
faith, and all other graces; which they call the conditions of
our justification in the sight of God; and indeed to be justified
by faith, according to them, is little other than to be justified
for faith: whether they reckon it a meritorious condition
or no, they must own it to be a pleadable condition; otherwise
it would have no reference to justification; and if it be
taken in this sense, our justification depends as much upon it,
as though it had been meritorious. This is the account which
some give of justification; and to prepare the way for this
opinion, they suppose, that the terms of salvation, in the gospel,
which are substituted in the room of those which were required
under the first covenant made with Adam, are faith,
repentance and sincere obedience, instead of perfect; and that
God in justifying a penitent, believing sinner, pursuant to the
performance of these conditions, declares his willingness, that
there should be a relaxation of that law which man was at first
obliged to obey; and accordingly, that sincerity is demanded
by him instead of perfection, or substituted in the room of it;
this they call the new law, or others style it a remedial law:
so that instead of being justified by Christ’s yielding perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>obedience, or paying the out-standing debt, which we were
obliged, by reason of the violation of the first covenant, to pay,
we are to be justified by our own imperfect obedience.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which may be objected to this method of reasoning,
is, that it is inconsistent with the holiness of the divine
nature, and the glory of the justice of God, detracts from the
honour of his law, and is, in effect, to maintain that we are justified
without satisfaction given. For though these terms of
our justification, and acceptance in the sight of God, may be
falsely styled a valuable consideration; yet none will pretend
to assert, that they are an infinite price; and nothing short of
that (which is no other than Christ’s righteousness) is sufficient
to answer this end. I am sensible, that they who lay down
this plan of justification, allege in defence thereof; that though
these terms of acceptance are of small value in themselves;
yet God, by an act of grace, reckons the payment of a small
debt equivalent to that of a greater, as has been before observed.
And they speak of faith and repentance as having a value
set upon them by their reference to the blood of Christ<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a>, who
merited this privilege for us, that we should be justified in such
a way, or upon these conditions performed: they call them indeed
easier terms, or conditions, and include them all in the
general word sincerity, instead of perfection. But they are
nevertheless somewhat divided in their method of explaining
themselves, inasmuch as some suppose these conditions to be
wholly in our own power, without the aids of divine grace, as
much as perfect obedience was in the power of our first parents;
whereas others ascribe a little more to the grace of God,
according as they explain the doctrine of effectual calling;
though they do not suppose, that these conditions are altogether
out of our own power; and they so far lay a foundation
for the sinner’s glorying herein, as that, they suppose, our right
to justification and eternal life is founded on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot but think this method of explaining the doctrine of
justification to be subversive of the gospel, and that it is highly
derogatory to the glory of God to assert that he can dispense
with the demand of perfect obedience, and justify a person on
easier terms; which is little better than what the apostle calls
<i>make void the law</i>: this, says he, we are far from doing <i>by
faith</i>, or by our asserting the doctrine of justification by faith
in Christ’s righteousness; <i>but we rather establish it</i> hereby:
and to say that God sets such a value on our performing these
conditions of the new covenant, as that they are deemed equivalent
to Christ’s performing perfect obedience for us, this reflects
on his glory, as set forth, to be a propitiation for sin, to
declare God’s righteousness in the remission thereof; and detracts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>from the obligation which we are laid under to him, for
what he did and suffered in our behalf, for our justification.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, to assert that God sets this value on our performances,
pursuant to Christ’s merit; or that they are highly esteemed
by him, because they are tinctured with his blood;
this is contrary to the design of his death, which was, not that
such an estimate might be set on what is done by us; but rather,
that the iniquities that attend our best performances may
be forgiven; and that (though, when we have done all, we are
unprofitable servants,) we may be made accepted in the Beloved;
and having no justifying righteousness of our own,
may be justified, and glory in that which he hath wrought out
for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for the supposition, that faith, repentance, and new
obedience, are not only conditions of justification, but easy to
be performed: this plainly discovers, that they who maintain
it, either think too lightly of man’s impotency and averseness
to what is good, and his alienation from the life of God, or are
strangers to their own hearts, and are not duly sensible that it
is God that works in his people both to will and to do, of his
own good pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only thing that I shall add, in opposition to the doctrine
of justification by works, is, that whatever is the matter
or ground of our justification in the sight of God, must be
pleadable at his bar; for we cannot be justified without a plea,
and if any plea, taken from our own works, be thought sufficient,
how much soever the proud and deluded heart of man
may set too great a value upon them; yet God will not reckon
the plea valid, so as to discharge us from guilt, and give us a
right and title to eternal life on the account thereof; which
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The method taken to explain this doctrine in the answer
before us, which we think agreeable to the divine perfections,
and contains a true state of the doctrine of justification by faith.
We before considered justification as a forensic act, that we
might understand what is meant by our sins being imputed to
Christ our Head and Surety, and his righteousness imputed to
us, or placed to our account. And we are now to speak of
this righteousness as pleaded by, or applied to us, as the foundation
of our claim to all the blessings that were purchased by
it. Here we must consider a sinner as bringing in his plea, in
order to his discharge; and this is twofold.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) If he be charged by men, or by Satan, with crimes not
committed, he pleads his own innocency; if charged with hypocrisy,
he pleads his own sincerity. Thus we are to understand
several expressions in scripture to this purpose; as for
instance, when a charge of the like nature was brought in against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Job, Satan having suggested that he did not serve God for
nought; and that if God would touch his bone and his flesh,
he would curse him to his face: and his friends having often
applied the character they give of the hypocrite to him, and so
concluding him to be a wicked person, he says, <i>God forbid that
I should justify you</i>; that is, that I should acknowledge your
charge to be just; <i>till I die, I will not remove mine integrity
from me: my righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live</i>, Job xxvii. 5,
6. that is, I never will own what you insinuate, that my heart
is not right with God. And David, when complaining of the
ill-treatment which he met with from his enemies and persecutors,
who desired not only to <i>tread down his life upon the earth</i>,
but to <i>lay his honour in the dust</i>; to murder his name as well
as his person, he prays, <i>Judge me, O Lord, according to my
righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me</i>,
Psal. vii. 8. What could he plead against maliciousness and
false insinuations, but his righteousness or his integrity? And
elsewhere, when he says, <i>The Lord rewarded me according to
my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath
he recompensed me: For I have kept the ways of the Lord; his
judgments were before me. I was also upright before him, and
have kept myself from mine iniquity</i>, 2 Sam. xxii. 21, <i>&amp;c. seq.</i>
it is nothing else but an intimation, that how much soever he
might be charged with the contrary vices, he was, in this respect,
innocent: and though God did not justify him at his
tribunal, for this righteousness; yet, in the course of his providence,
he seemed to approve of his plea, so far as that whatever
the world thought of him, he plainly dealt with him as
one who was highly favoured by him; or whom, by his dealings
with him, he evidently distinguished from those whose
hearts were not right with him. It is true, some who plead
for justification by our own righteousness, allege these scriptures
as a proof of it, without distinguishing between the justification
of our persons in the sight of God, and the justification
of our righteous cause; or our being justified when accused
at God’s tribunal, and our being justified, or vindicated
from those charges that are brought against us at man’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When a person stands at God’s tribunal, as we must
suppose the sinner to do, when bringing in his plea for justification
in his sight; then he has nothing else to plead but Christ’s
righteousness; and faith is that grace that pleads it: and in
that respect we are said to be justified by faith, or in a way of
believing. Faith doth not justify by presenting or pleading itself,
or any other grace that accompanies or flows from it, as
the cause why God should forgive sin, or give us a right to
eternal life; for they have not sufficient worth or excellency in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>them to procure these blessings. Therefore, when we are said
to be justified by faith, it is by faith, as apprehending, pleading,
or laying hold on Christ’s righteousness; and this gives
occasion to divines to call it the instrument of our justification.
Christ’s righteousness is the thing claimed or apprehended;
and faith is that by which it is claimed or apprehended; and,
agreeably to the idea of an instrument, we are said not to be
justified for faith, but by it. Christ’s righteousness is that
which procures a discharge from condemnation for all for whom
it was wrought out; faith is the hand that receives it; whereby
a person has a right to conclude, that it was wrought out
for him. Christ’s righteousness is that which has a tendency
to enrich and adorn the soul; and faith is the hand that receives
it, whereby it becomes ours, in a way of fiducial application:
and as the righteousness of Christ is compared, in
scripture, to a glorious robe, which renders the soul beautiful,
or is its highest and chief ornament; it is by faith that it
is put on; and, in this respect, as the prophet speaks, its beauty
is rendered <i>perfect through his comeliness, which is put upon
him</i>, Ezek. xvi. 14. so that Christ’s righteousness justifies, as
it is the cause of our discharge; faith justifies as the instrument
that applies this discharge to us; thus when it is said, <i>the
just shall live by faith</i>, faith is considered as that which seeks
to, and finds this life in him; the effect is, by a metonymy,
applied to the instrument; as when the husbandman is said to
live or to be maintained by his plough, and the artist to live by
his hands, or the beggar by his empty hand that receives the
donative. If a person was in a dungeon, like the prophet Jeremiah,
and a rope is let down to draw him out of it, his laying
hold on it is the instrument, but the hand that draws him
out, is the principal cause of his release from thence; or, that
we may make use of a similitude that more directly illustrates
the doctrine we are maintaining, suppose a condemned malefactor
had a pardon procured for him, which gives him a right
to liberty, or a discharge from the place of his confinement,
this must be pleaded, and his claim be rendered visible; and
after that he is no longer deemed a guilty person, but discharged,
in open court, from the sentence that he was under. Thus
Christ procures forgiveness by his blood; the gospel holds it
forth, and describes those who have a right to claim it as belonging
to him in particular: and hence arises a visible discharge
from condemnation, and a right to claim the benefits
that attend it. If we understand justification by faith, in this
sense, we do not attribute too much to faith on the one hand,
nor too little to Christ’s righteousness on the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we rather choose to call faith an instrument, than a
condition of our justification, being sensible, that the word <i>condition</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>is generally used to signify that for the sake whereof, a
benefit is conferred, rather than the instrument by which it is
applied; not but that it may be explained in such a way, as is
consistent with the doctrine of justification by faith, as before
considered. We do not deny that faith is the condition of our
claim to Christ’s righteousness; or that it is God’s ordinance,
without which we have no ground to conclude our interest in
it. We must therefore distinguish between its being a condition
of forgiveness, and its being a condition of our visible and
apparent right hereunto. This cannot be said to belong to us,
unless we receive it; neither can we conclude that we have an
interest in Christ’s redemption, any more than they for whom
he did not lay down his life, but by this medium. We must
first consider Christ’s righteousness as wrought out for all them
that were given him by the Father; and faith is that which
gives us ground to conclude, that this privilege, in particular,
belongs to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>This account of the use of faith in justification, we cannot
but think sufficient to obviate the most material objections that
are brought against our way of maintaining the doctrine of justification,
<i>viz.</i> by Christ’s righteousness, in one respect, and
by faith in another. It is an injurious suggestion to suppose
that we deny the necessity of faith in any sense, or conclude,
that we may lay claim to this privilege without it; since we
strenuously assert the necessity, on the one hand, of Christ’s
righteousness being wrought out for us, and forgiveness procured
thereby; and, on the other hand, the necessity of our receiving
it, each of which is true in its respective place. Christ
must have the glory that is due to him, and faith the work, or
office that belongs to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have considered Christ’s righteousness as applied
by faith; and it may be also observed, that there is one scripture,
in which it is said to be <i>imputed by faith</i>, as the apostle
Paul, when speaking concerning Abraham’s justification by
faith, in this righteousness, says, <i>It was imputed to him for
righteousness</i>; and adds, that <i>it was not written for his sake
alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us also, to whom it
shall be imputed, if we believe</i>, Rom. iv. 22, 23, 24. in which
scripture, I conceive, that imputation is taken for application;
and accordingly the meaning is, the righteousness of Christ is
so imputed, as that we have ground to place it to our own account,
if we believe; which is the same with applying it by
faith.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>And whereas the apostle speaks elsewhere of <i>faith’s being
counted for righteousness</i>, ver. 5. it must be allowed, that there
is a great deal of difficulty in the mode of expression. If we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>assert that the act of believing is imputed for righteousness, as
they who establish the doctrine of justification by works, or by
faith as a work, we overthrow that which we have been maintaining:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and if, on the other hand, we understand faith, for
the object of faith, <i>viz.</i> what was wrought out by Christ, which
faith is conversant about, and conclude, (as I conceive we ought
to do,) that this, is imputed for righteousness, this is supposed,
by some, to deviate too much from the common sense of
words, to be allowed of: but if there be such a figurative way
of speaking used in other scriptures, why may we not suppose
that it is used in this text under our present consideration? If
other graces are sometimes taken for the object thereof, why
may not faith be taken, by a metonymy, for its object? Thus
the apostle calls those whom he writes to, <i>his joy</i>, that is, the
object, or matter thereof, Phil. iv. 1. And in the book of Canticles,
the church calls Christ <i>her love</i>, Cant. iv. 8. that is, the
object thereof. And elsewhere, hope is plainly taken for the
object of it, when the apostle says, <i>Hope that is seen, is not
hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</i> Rom.
viii. 24. By which he plainly intends, that whatever is the
object of hope, cannot be in our present possession: and Christ
is farther styled, <i>The blessed hope</i>, Tit. ii. 13. that is, the person
whose appearance we hope for. And Jacob speaks of God
as <i>the fear of his father Isaac</i>, Gen. xxxi. 53. that is, the person
whom he worshipped with reverential fear; in all which
cases the phraseology is equally difficult with that of the text,
under our present consideration. Thus concerning Christ’s
righteousness, as wrought out for us, and applied by faith;
which is the foundation of all our peace and comfort, both in
life and death; and therefore cannot but be reckoned a doctrine
of the highest importance: we shall now consider some things
that may be inferred from it. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] From what has been said concerning justification, as
founded in Christ’s suretyship-righteousness, wrought out for
us, by what was done and suffered by him, in his human nature;
and the infinite value thereof, as depending on the glory
of the divine nature, to which it is united, we cannot but infer
the absurdity of two contrary opinions, namely, that of those
who have asserted, that we are justified by the essential righteousness
of Christ as God<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a>; and that of others, who pretend,
that because all mediatorial acts are performed by Christ only
as man: therefore the infinite dignity of the divine nature, has
no reference to their being satisfactory to divine justice. This
is what they mean when they say, that we are justified by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Christ’s righteousness as man, in opposition to our being justified
by his essential righteousness as God<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a>: whereas, I think,
the truth lies in a <i>medium</i> between both these extremes; on the
one hand we must suppose, that Christ’s engagement to become
a surety for us, and so stand in our room and stead, and
thereby to pay the debt which we had contracted to the justice
of God, could not be done in any other than the human nature;
for the divine nature is not capable of being under a law,
or fulfilling it, or, in any instance, of obeying, or suffering;
and therefore, we cannot be justified by Christ’s essential righteousness,
as God; and, on the other hand, what Christ did
and suffered as man, would not have been sufficient for our
justification, had it not had an infinite value put upon it, arising
from the union of the nature that suffered with the divine
nature, which is agreeable to the apostle’s expression, when
he says, <i>God purchased the church with his own blood</i>, Acts,
xx. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] From what has been said, concerning the fruits and effects
of justification, as by virtue hereof our sins are pardoned,
and we made accepted in the beloved, we infer; that it is not
only an unscriptural way of speaking, but has a tendency to
overthrow the doctrine we have been maintaining, to assert, as
some do, that God is only rendered reconcileable by what was
done and suffered by Christ. This seems to be maintained by
those who treat on this subject, with a different view. Some
speak of God’s being rendered reconcileable by Christ’s righteousness
that they might make way for what they have farther
to advance, namely, that God’s being reconciled to a sinner,
is the result of his own repentance, or the amendment of his
life, whereby he makes his peace with him; which is to make
repentance or reformation the matter of our justification, and
substitute it in the room of Christ’s righteousness: therefore,
they who speak of God’s being made reconcileable in this sense,
by his blood, are so far from giving a true account of the doctrine
of justification, that, in reality, they overthrow it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are others, who speak of God’s being reconcileable
as the consequence of Christ’s satisfaction, that they might
not be thought to assert that God is actually reconciled by the
blood of Christ, to those who are in an unconverted state, which
is inconsistent therewith; therefore they use this mode of expression,
lest they should be thought to give countenance to the
doctrine of actual justification before faith; but certainly we
are under no necessity of advancing one absurdity to avoid another:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>therefore, let it be here considered, that the scripture
speaks expressly of God’s being reconciled by the death of
Christ; and accordingly he is said to have <i>brought</i> him <i>again
from the dead</i>, as a <i>God of peace</i>, Heb. xiii. 20. And elsewhere,
he speaks of <i>God’s having reconciled us to himself by Jesus
Christ</i>, 2 Cor. v. 18. and not becoming reconcilable to us.
Again, <i>When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved</i>,
Rom. v. 10. that is, shall obtain the saving effects of this reconciliation
<i>by his life</i>. And again, <i>Having made peace through
the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself:
and you that were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your
mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body
of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable,
and unreprovable in his sight</i>, Col. i. 21, 22. Where he describes
those who were reconciled as once enemies, and speaks
of this privilege as being procured by the death of Christ, and
of holiness here, and salvation hereafter, as the consequence of
it; therefore it is such a reconciliation as is contained in our
justification.</p>

<p class='c006'>But though this appears very agreeable to the mind of the
Holy Ghost, in scripture, yet it must be understood in consistency
with those other scriptures, that represent persons in
an unconverted state, as <i>children of wrath</i>, Eph. ii. 3. and being
<i>hateful</i>, Tit. iii. 3. that is, not only deserving to be hated
by God, but actually hated, as appears by the many threatnings
that are denounced against them, and their being in a
condemned state, that we may not give countenance to the doctrine
of some, who, not distinguishing between God’s secret
and revealed will, maintain that we are not only virtually, but
actually justified before we believe; as though we had a right
to claim Christ’s righteousness before we have any ground to
conclude, that it was wrought out for us: but what has been
already suggested concerning justification by faith, will, I think,
sufficiently remove this difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only thing that remains to be explained is; how God
may be said to be reconciled by the blood of Christ, to a person
who is in an unconverted state, and as such, represented as
a child of wrath? for the understanding of which, let us consider,
that so long as a person is an unbeliever, he has no
ground to conclude, according to the tenor of God’s revealed
will, that he is reconciled to him, or that he is any other than
a child of wrath. Nevertheless, when we speak of God’s being
reconciled to his elect, according to the tenor of his secret
will, before they believe, that is in effect to say, that justification,
as it is an immanent act in God, is antecedent to faith,
which is a certain truth, inasmuch as faith is a fruit and consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>thereof: whereas, God does not declare that he is
reconciled to us, or give us ground to conclude it; whereby we
appear no longer to be children of wrath, till we believe. If
this be duly considered, we have no reason to assert, that God
is reconcileable, rather than reconciled by the death of Christ,
lest we should be thought to maintain the doctrine of justification,
or deliverance from wrath, as a declared act, before we
believe. And to this we may add, that God was reconcileable
to his elect, that is, willing to be reconciled to them before
Christ died for them; otherwise he would never have sent him
into the world to make reconciliation for the sins of his people:
he was reconcileable, and therefore designed to turn from
the fierceness of his wrath; and in order thereunto, he appointed
Christ to make satisfaction for sin, and procure peace
for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] There is not the least inconsistency between those scriptures
which speak of justification as being an act of God’s free
grace, and others, which speak of it as being, by faith, founded
on Christ’s righteousness; or between God’s pardoning sin
freely, without regard to any thing done by us to procure it;
and yet insisting on, and receiving a full satisfaction, as the
meritorious and procuring cause of it. This is sometimes objected
against what we have advanced in explaining the doctrine
of justification, as being, in some respects, an act of justice,
and in others, of grace; as though it were inconsistent
with itself, and our method of explaining it were liable to an
absurdity, which is contrary to reason; as though two contradictory
propositions could be both true; namely, that justification
should be an act of the strictest justice, without any abatement
of the debt demanded, and yet of free grace, without
insisting on the payment of the debt: but this seeming contradiction
may be easily reconciled, if we consider that the debt
was not paid by us in our own persons; which had it been
done, it would have been inconsistent with forgiveness’s being
an act of grace; but by our surety, and in that respect there
was no abatement of the debt, nor did he receive a discharge
by an act of grace, but was justified as our head or surety, by
his own righteousness, or works performed by him; whereas,
we are justified by his suretyship-righteousness, without works
performed by us; and this surety was provided for us; as has
been before observed; and therefore, when we speak of justification,
as being an act of grace, we distinguish between the
justification of our surety, after he had given full satisfaction
for the debt which we had contracted; and this payment’s being
placed to our account by God’s gracious imputation thereof
to us, and our obtaining forgiveness as the result thereof,
which can be no other than an act of the highest grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>[4.] From what has been said concerning justification by
faith, we infer, the method, order and time, in which God justifies
his people. There are some who not only speak of justification
before faith, but from eternity; and consider it as an
immanent act in God in the same sense as election is said to
be. I will not deny eternal justification, provided it be considered
as contained in God’s secret will, and not made the
rule by which we are to determine ourselves to be in a justified
state, and as such to have a right and title to eternal life,
before it is revealed or apprehended by faith: if we take it in
this sense, it is beyond dispute, that justification is not by faith;
but inasmuch as the most known, yea, the only sense in which
justification is spoken of, as applied to particular persons, is,
that it is by faith: therefore, we must suppose,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is a declared act. That which is hid in God,
and not declared, cannot be said to be applied; and that which
is not applied, cannot be the rule by which particular persons
may judge of their state. Thus, if we speak of eternal election,
and say, That God has peremptorily determined the state
of those that shall be saved, that they shall not perish; this is
nothing to particular persons, unless they have ground to conclude
themselves elected. So if we say that God has, from all
eternity, given his elect into Christ’s hands; that he has undertaken
before the foundation of the world, to redeem them;
and that, pursuant hereunto, God promised that he would give
eternal life unto them; or, if we consider Christ as having fulfilled
what he undertook from all eternity, finished transgression,
brought in everlasting righteousness, and fully paid the
debt which he undertook; consider him as being discharged,
and receiving an acquittance, when raised from the dead;
and all this as done in the name of the elect, as their head and
representative; and if you farther consider them, as it is often
expressed, as virtually justified in him; all this is nothing to
them, with respect to their peace and comfort; they have no
more a right to claim an interest in this privilege or relation,
than if he had not paid a price for them. Therefore, we suppose
that justification, as it is the foundation of our claim to
eternal life, is a declared act.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d.</i> If justification be a declared act, there must be some
method which God uses, whereby he declares, or makes it
known. Now it is certain, that he, no where in scripture, tells
an unbeliever that he has an interest in Christ’s righteousness,
or that his sins are pardoned, or gives him any warrant to take
comfort from any such conclusion; but, on the other hand,
such an one has no ground to conclude any other, concerning
himself, but that he is a child of wrath; for he is to judge of
things according to the tenor of God’s revealed will. Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>righteousness is nothing to him in point of application; he is
guilty of bold presumption if he lays claim to it, or takes comfort
from it, as much as he would be were he to say, some are
elected, therefore I am. Nevertheless,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3d</i>, When a person believes, he has a right to conclude, that
he is justified, or to claim all the privileges that result from it;
and this is what we call justification by faith, which therefore
cannot be before faith; for that which gives a person a right
to claim a privilege, must be antecedent to this claim; or, that
which is the foundation of a person’s concluding himself to be
justified, must be antecedent to his making this conclusion;
and in this respect, all who duly consider what they affirm,
must conclude that justification is not before faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] From what has been said concerning the office or use
of faith in justification, as it is an instrument that applies
Christ’s righteousness to ourselves, we infer; that it is more
than an evidence of our justification: we do not indeed deny
it to be an evidence that we were virtually justified in Christ
as our head and representative, when he was raised from the
dead, in the same sense as it is an evidence of our eternal election:
but this is equally applicable to all other graces, and therefore
cannot be a true description of justifying faith. If we are
justified by faith, only as it is an evidence of our right to
Christ’s righteousness, we are as much justified by love, patience,
and submission to the divine will, or any other grace
that accompanies salvation; but they who speak of faith as only
an evidence, will not say that we are justified by all other
graces, in the same sense as we are justified by faith; and indeed,
the scripture gives us no warrant so to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] From what has been said concerning faith as giving us
a right to claim Christ’s righteousness, we infer; that a person
is justified before he has what we call, the faith of assurance;
of which more hereafter: therefore we consider the
grace of faith, as justifying or giving us a right to claim Christ’s
righteousness, whether we have an actual claim or no. This
must be allowed, otherwise the loss of this assurance would infer
the suspension or loss of our justification, and consequently
would render our state as uncertain as our frames, or our peace
with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, as liable to be lost
as that peace and joy which we sometimes have in believing,
and at other times are destitute of.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] From what has been said concerning justifying faith’s
being accompanied with all other graces, we infer; that that
faith which is justifying, is also a saving grace, or a grace which
accompanies salvation; but yet there is this difference between
saving faith, as we generally call it, and justifying, in that the
former respects Christ in all his offices, the latter considers him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>only in his Priestly office, or as set forth to be a propitiation
for sin. And this leads us to consider the grace of faith in its
larger extent, both with respect to its acts and objects, as contained
in the former of the answers we are explaining: and
therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now to consider the nature of faith in general, or of
that faith, which, as before explained, we call justifying. There
are some things in this grace which are common to it with
other graces; particularly, it is styled a saving grace, not as
being the cause of our salvation, but as it accompanies, or is
connected with it. Again, it is said to be wrought in the heart
of a sinner, to distinguish it from other habits of a lower nature,
which are acquired by us; and it is said to be wrought
by the Spirit and Word of God; by his Spirit, as the principal
efficient, who, in order thereunto, exerts his divine power; and
by the word, as the instrument which he makes use of. The
Word presents to us the object of faith; and it is God’s ordinance,
in attending to which, he works and excites it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, there are several things supposed or contained in
this grace of faith, which are common to it, with other graces.
As when a believer is said to be first convinced of sin and misery,
and of his being unable to recover himself out of the lost
condition in which he is, by nature; and the impossibility of
his being recovered out of it by any other creature; in all these
respects, faith contains in it several things in common with
other graces; particularly with conversion, effectual calling, and
repentance unto life. These things, therefore, we shall pass over
as being considered elsewhere, and confine ourselves to what is
peculiar to this grace mentioned in this answer; only some few
things may be observed concerning it, as it is styled a saving
grace, and wrought in the heart of man, by the Spirit and Word
of God; and we shall add some other things, of which we have
no particular account in this answer; which may contain a more
full explication of this grace: in speaking to which, we shall
observe the following method;</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider the meaning of the word <i>faith</i>, in the
more general idea of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall speak particularly concerning the various kinds
of <i>faith</i>. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The various objects and acts of saving faith; especially
as it assents to the truth of the promise of the gospel, and receives,
and rests upon, Christ and his righteousness, held forth
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall consider it as a grace that accompanies salvation,
and wrought in the heart by the power of the Spirit,
and instrumentality of the word.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>V. We shall consider it as strong or weak, increasing or
declining, with the various marks and evidences thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. We shall speak of the use of faith in the whole conduct
of our lives; as every thing we do in an acceptable manner, is
said to be done by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. We shall shew how it is to be attained or increased,
and what are the means conducive thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the meaning of the word <i>faith</i>, in the more
general idea thereof. It is either an assent to a truth, founded
on sufficient evidence; or a confiding or relying on the word
or power of one, who is able and willing to afford us sufficient
help or relief.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the former of these, as it contains an assent to a
truth proposed and supported by sufficient evidence. This is
more especially an act of the understanding; and it is necessary,
in order hereunto, that something be discovered to us,
as the matter of our belief, which demands or calls for our assent;
and that is considered either only as true, or else, as true
and good: if it be considered only as true, the faith, or assent
that is required thereunto is speculative; but if we consider it
not only as true, but good, or, as containing something redounding
to our advantage; then the faith resulting from it is practical,
and seated partly in the understanding, and partly in the
will; or, at least, the will is influenced and inclined to embrace
what the understanding not only assents to as true, but proposes
to us as that which if enjoyed would tend very much to
our advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to this general description of faith, as an assent to what
is reported, founded upon sufficient evidence, we may farther
consider;<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> that it is not in our power to believe a thing, unless
the judgment be convinced, and we have ground to conclude
it to be true, and accordingly there must be something
which has a tendency to give this conviction; and that it is
what we call evidence: every thing that is reported is not to
be credited; since it has very often no appearance of truth in
it: and it is reasonable for the understanding, to demand a proof
before it yields an assent; and if it be a matter of report, then
we are to consider the nature of the evidence, whether it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>sufficient, or insufficient to persuade us to believe what is reported;
and according to the strength or credibility thereof,
we believe, hesitate about it, or utterly reject it. If, according
to our present view of things, it may be true or false, we hardly
call it the object of faith; we can only say concerning it, that
it is probable; if it be, on the other hand, attested by such evidence,
as cannot, without scepticism be denied; hence arises
what we call certainty, or an assurance of faith, supported by
the strongest evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, according to the nature of the evidence, or testimony,
on which it is founded, it is distinguished into human
and divine; both of these are contained in the apostle’s words,
<i>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater</i>,
1 John v. 9. As for human testimony, though it may not be
termed false, yet it can hardly be deemed any other than fallible,
since it cannot be said concerning sinful man, that it is impossible
for him to lie or deceive, or be deceived himself;
but when we believe a thing on the divine testimony, our faith
is infallible: it is as impossible for us to be deceived as it is for
God to impart that to us, which is contrary to his infinite holiness
and veracity. It is in this latter sense that we consider
the word <i>faith</i>, when we speak of it as an act of religious worship,
or included or supposed in our idea of saving faith; and
so we style it a firm assent to every thing that God has revealed
as founded on the divine veracity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now consider faith as it contains an assent to a thing,
not only as true, but as good; upon which account we call it
a practical assent, first seated in the understanding; and then
the will embraces what the understanding discovers to be conducive
to our happiness; we first believe the truth of it, and
then regulate our conduct agreeably thereunto. As when a criminal
hears a report of an act of grace being issued forth by
the king, he does not rest in a bare assent to the truth thereof,
but puts in his claim to it. Or, as when a merchant is credibly
informed, that there are great advantages to be obtained by trading
into foreign countries; he receives the report with a design
to use all proper methods to partake of the advantage; as
our Saviour illustrates it, when he compares <i>the kingdom of
heaven unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls; who, when
he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he
had, and bought</i>, Matt. xiii. 45. We have sufficient evidence
to support our faith, that there is forgiveness of sin, through
the blood of Christ; and that all spiritual blessings are treasured
up in him, for the heirs of salvation: in this respect faith
does not contain a bare speculative assent to the truth of this
proposition; but it excites in us an endeavour to obtain these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>blessings in that way which is prescribed by him, who is the
giver thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Faith may be farther considered, as denoting an act of
trust or dependence on him, who is the object thereof. This is
very distinct from the former sense of the word: for though it
supposes indeed an assent of the understanding to some truth
proposed; yet this truth is of such a nature, as that it produces
in us a resting or reliance on one who is able, and has expressed
a willingness to do us good; and whose promise relating hereunto,
is such, as we have ground to depend on. This supposes
in him, who is the subject thereof, a sense of his own weakness
or indigence, and in him that is the object of it, a fitness
to be the object of trust, for his attaining relief: thus the sick
man depends upon the skill and faithfulness of the physician,
and determines to look no farther for help, but relies on his
prescriptions, and uses the means that he appoints for the restoring
of his health; or, as when a person is assaulted by one
who threatens to ruin him, and is able to do it, as being an
over-match for him, he has recourse to, and depends on the
assistance of one that is able to secure and defend him, and
thereby prevent the danger that he feared. Thus Jehoshaphat,
when his country was invaded by a great multitude of foreign
troops, being apprehensive that he was not able to withstand
them; he exercises this faith of reliance on the divine power,
when he says, <i>We have no might against this great company,
that come against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes
are upon thee</i>, 2 Chron. xx. 12. And God is very often, in
scripture, represented as the object of trust: so the church says,
<i>I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my
strength</i>; and elsewhere, <i>he that walketh in darkness and hath
no light</i>, Isa. xii. 2. that is, knows not which way to turn, is
helpless and destitute of all comfort, is encouraged to <i>trust in
the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God</i>, chap. l. 10. This
is truly and properly a divine faith, and accordingly an act of
religious worship; and is opposed to a <i>trusting in man, and
making flesh his arm</i>, Jer. xvii. 5. and it supposes a firm persuasion,
that God is able to do all that for us which we stand
in need of; and that he has promised that he will do us good,
and that he will never fail nor forsake them that repose their
trust or confidence in him: with this view the soul relies on
his perfections, seeks to him for comfort, and lays the whole
stress of his hope of salvation on him, not doubting concerning
the event hereof, but concluding himself safe, if he can say, that
<i>the eternal God is his refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
arms</i>, Deut. xxxiii. 27. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider the various kinds of faith, as mentioned in
scripture. Thus we read of a faith that was adapted to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>extraordinary dispensation of providence, in which God was
pleased to confirm some great and important truths by miracles;
which is therefore styled a faith of miracles. There is
also a faith that has no reference to a supernatural event, or
confined to any particular age or state of the church, in which
miracles are expected, but is founded on the gospel-revelation,
which, how much soever it may resemble saving faith, yet falls
short of it; and there is a faith which is inseparably connected
with salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning the faith of miracles. This is what our Saviour
intends, when he tells his disciples, That <i>if they had faith
as a grain of mustard-seed, they should say unto this mountain,
Remove hence to yonder place, and it should remove; and nothing
should be impossible unto them</i>, Matt. xvii. 20. This is
such a faith that many had, who were not in a state of salvation;
as is plain from what our Saviour says, that <i>many will
say to him in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
name have done many wonderful works? to whom he will profess
I never knew you</i>; and his commanding them to <i>depart
from him</i> as having <i>wrought iniquity</i>, chap. vii. 22, 23. And
the apostle Paul supposes, that a person might have <i>all faith</i>,
that is, this kind of faith; <i>so that he might remove mountains</i>,
1 Cor. xiii. 2. which is a proverbial expression, denoting, that
extraordinary and miraculous events might attend it; and yet,
at the same time, be destitute of <i>charity</i>, or love to God, and
consequently without saving grace; and so appear, in the end,
to <i>be nothing</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some have questioned whether this faith of miracles was
peculiar to the gospel-dispensation, in the time of our Saviour
and the apostles, and so was not required in those who wrought
miracles under the Old Testament dispensation; though others
suppose, that, from the nature of the thing, it was always necessary
that faith should be exercised, when a miracle was
wrought; though it is true, we have little or no account of
this faith, as exercised by those that wrought miracles before
our Saviour’s time; and therefore, we cannot so peremptorily
determine this matter; but according to the account we have
thereof in the New Testament, there were several things necessary
to, or included in this faith of miracles.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Some important article of revealed religion must be
proposed to be believed; and in order thereunto, an explicit
appeal made to God, in expectation of his immediate interposure
in working a miracle for that end: every thing that was
the object of faith, was not, indeed, to be proved true by a
miracle, but only those things which could not be sufficiently
evinced without it, so as to beget a divine faith in those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>were the subjects of conviction. We never read that miracles
were wrought to convince the world that there was a God, or
a providence; or, to persuade men concerning the truth of
those things that might be sufficiently proved by rational arguments:
but when there could not be such a proof given without
the finger of God being rendered visible by a miracle
wrought, then they depended on such an instance of divine condescension;
and the people who were to receive conviction,
were to expect such an extraordinary event.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It was necessary that there should be a firm persuasion
of the truth of the doctrine, to be confirmed by a miracle in
him that wrought it, together with an explicit appeal to it for
the conviction of those whose faith was to be confirmed thereby:
and sometimes we read, that when miracles were to be
wrought in favour of them, who before had a sufficient proof
that our Saviour was the Messiah, it was necessary that they
should have a strong persuasion concerning this matter, and
that he was able to work a miracle; otherwise they had no
ground to expect that the miracle should be wrought: in the
former instance we read of Christ’s disciples working miracles
for the conviction of the Jews, and exercising, at the same
time, this faith of miracles; and in the latter a general faith
was demanded, that our Saviour was the Messiah, before the
miracle was wrought; in which sense we are to understand his
reply to the man who desired that he would cast the Devil out
of his son; <i>If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him
that believeth</i>, Mark ix. 23. <i>q. d.</i> Thou hast had sufficient conviction
that I am the Messiah, by other miracles, and consequently
hast no reason to doubt but that I can cast the Devil
out of thy son; therefore, if thou hast a strong persuasion of
the truth hereof, the thing that thou desirest shall be granted:
and elsewhere it is said, <i>He did not many mighty works because
of their unbelief</i>, Matt. xiii. 58.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) How much soever a person might exercise this strong
persuasion, that a miracle should be wrought, which we generally
call a faith of miracles; yet I cannot think that this event
always ensued without exception. For sometimes God might
refuse to work a miracle, that he might hereby cast contempt
on some vile persons, who pretended to this faith of miracles;
who, though they professed their faith in Christ as the Messiah,
yet their conversation contradicted their profession, and
therefore God would not put that honour upon them so as to
work a miracle at their desire; much less are we to suppose,
that he would work a miracle at any one’s pleasure, if they
were persuaded that he would do so. Again, sometimes God
might refuse to exert his divine power, in working a miracle,
in judgment, when persons had had sufficient means for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>conviction by other miracles, but believed not. And finally,
when the truth of the Christian religion had been sufficiently
confirmed by miracles, they were less common; and then we
read nothing more of that faith which took its denomination
from thence.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There is another kind of faith, which has some things in
common with saving faith, and is sometimes mistaken for it,
but is vastly different from it. This, in some, is called an
historical faith; and in others, by reason of the short continuance
thereof, a temporary faith. An historical faith is that
whereby persons are convinced of the truth of what is revealed
in the gospel, though this has very little influence on their
conversation: such have right notions of divine things, but do
not entertain a suitable regard to them; religion with them is
little more than a matter of speculation; they do not doubt concerning
any of the important doctrines of the gospel, but are
able and ready to defend them by proper arguments: nevertheless,
though, in words, they profess their faith in Christ, in
works they deny him: such as these the apostle intends when
he says; <i>Thou believest that there is one God, thou dost well:
the devils also believe and tremble</i>, James ii. 19. And he charges
them with a vain presumption, in that they expected to be
justified hereby; whereas their faith was without works, or
those fruits which were necessary to justify, or evince its sincerity;
or to prove that it was such a grace as accompanies
salvation; and therefore he gives it no better a character than
that of a dead faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for that which is called a temporary faith, this differs
little from the former, unless we consider it, as having a tendency,
in some measure, to excite the affections; and so far
to regulate the conversation, as that which is attended with a
form of godliness, which continues as long as this comports
with, or is subservient to their secular interest: but it is not
such a faith as will enable them to pass through fiery trials, or
part with all things for Christ’s sake, or to rejoice in him, as
their portion, when they meet with little but tribulation and
persecution, in the world, for the sake of the gospel. This
will evidently discover the insincerity thereof; for it will wither
like a plant that is without a root: our Saviour speaks of
it in the parable, of the <i>seed that fell upon stony places, where
they had not much earth, and forthwith they sprang up, because
they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was up,
they were scorched; and because they had no root they withered
away</i>; which he explains of him, <i>who heareth the word,
and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in himself,
but endureth for a while; for when tribulation or persecution
ariseth, because of thy word, by and by he is offended</i>, Matt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>xiii. 5, 6. compared with ver. 20, 21. This parable had a particular
relation to the Jews, who heard John the Baptist gladly,
rejoicing in his light for a season; and seemed to be convinced,
by his doctrine, concerning the Messiah, who was
shortly to appear; but when they apprehended that his kingdom,
instead of advancing them to great honours in the world,
was like to expose them to tribulations and persecutions they
were offended in him; and this is also applicable to all those
who think themselves something, and are thought so by others,
as to the profession they make of Christ and his gospel; but
afterwards appear to be nothing, deceiving their own souls.
This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. To consider faith as a grace that is inseparably connected
with salvation, which is called justifying faith, and also a saving
grace, in this answer, in which the nature thereof is explained;
and what may be farther said concerning it will be
considered under the following heads, which we proposed to
insist on in the general method before laid down; and therefore
we shall proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. To speak concerning the various objects and acts of
saving faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning its objects. Every thing that is the object
thereof, must take its rise from God; for we are now speaking
concerning a divine faith; and inasmuch as saving faith supposes
and includes in it an assent to the truth of divine revelation,
we are bound to believe whatever God has revealed in
his word; so that as all scripture is the rule of faith, the matter
thereof is the object of faith: and as scripture contains an
historical relation of things, these are the objects of faith, and
we are to yield an assent to what God reveals, as being of infallible
verity. As it is a rule of duty and obedience, we are
bound to believe so as to adore the sovereignty of God, commanding
to submit to his authority therein, as having a right
to give laws to our consciences, and acknowledge ourselves
his subjects and servants, under an indispensable obligation to
yield the obedience of faith to him: as it contains many
great and precious promises, these are the objects of faith, as
we are to desire, hope for, and depend on the faithfulness of
God for the accomplishment of them; and more particularly
considering them as they are all, yea and amen, in Christ to
the glory of God. As for the threatnings which relate to the
wrath of God, due to sin, and warnings to fence the soul against
it, and induce us to abhor and hate it; these are objects of
faith, so far as that we must believe and tremble, and see the
need we stand in of grace, which we receive by faith to enable
us to improve them, that through the virtue of Christ’s
righteousness we may hope to escape his wrath; and by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>strength be fortified against the prevalency of corruption, that
has proved destructive to multitudes.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the principal object of faith is God in Christ, our great
Mediator:<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> thus our Saviour says, <i>Ye believe in God, believe
also in me</i>, John xiv. 1. This is sometimes styled coming to
the Father by him; as it is elsewhere said, <i>No man cometh unto
the Father but by me</i>: or else, coming to him as Mediator
immediately, that in him we may obtain whatever he has purchased
for us, and thereby may have access to God, as to our
reconciled God and Father; and in so doing, obtain eternal
life, as he expresses it; <i>He that cometh to me shall never hunger;
and he that believeth on me shall never thirst</i>, chap. vi. 35.
Which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Those particular acts of saving faith, in which we have to
do with Christ as Mediator, whereby we have access to God,
through him: there are several expressions in scripture, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>which these acts of saving faith are set forth, some of which
are metaphorical; more particularly it is called a looking to
him; thus he is represented, by the prophet, as saying, <i>Look
unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth</i>, Isa. xlv. 22.
Sometimes by coming to him, pursuant to the invitation he
gives, <i>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest</i>, Mat. xi. 25. which coming is elsewhere
explained, as in the scripture before-mentioned, by <i>believing
in him</i>, John vi. 35. And as we hope for refreshment
and comfort in so doing, it is set forth by that, metaphorical
expression, of <i>coming to the waters</i> and <i>buying wine and milk
without money and without price</i>, Isa. lv. 1. that is, receiving
from him those blessings which tend to satisfy and exhilirate
the soul, which are given to such as have nothing to offer for
them; and sometimes it is represented by flying to him; or,
as the apostle expresses it, <i>flying for refuge to lay hold upon
the hope set before us</i>, Heb. vi. 18. as alluding to that eminent
type thereof, contained in the man-slayer’s flying to the city
of refuge, from the avenger of blood, and therein finding protection
and safety: this is a description more especially of faith
as justifying; in which respect it is elsewhere described, as <i>a
putting on the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, Rom. xiii. 14. or the glorious
robe of his righteousness, on which account we are said to
be <i>clothed with the garments of salvation, and covered with the
robe of righteousness</i>, Isa. lxi. 10. And when we are enabled
to apprehend our interest in him by faith, together with the
blessings that are the result hereof, we are said to rejoice in
Christ Jesus. There are many other expressions by which
this grace is set forth in scripture; but those acts thereof,
which we shall more especially consider, are our receiving
Christ, giving up ourselves to him, and trusting in, or relying
on him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Faith is that grace whereby we receive Christ. Thus
it is said, <i>as many as received him, to them gave he power to
become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name</i>,
John i. 12. This contains in it the application of an overture
made by him; not barely of something that he has to bestow,
which might contribute to our happiness, but of himself. Christ
has many things to bestow upon his people; but he first gives
himself; that is, he expresses a willingness to be their Prince
and Saviour, their Prophet, Priest, and King; that being thus
related, and adhering to him, they may be made partakers of
his benefits, which are the result thereof; and accordingly the
soul, by faith applies itself to him, and embraces the overture.
Hereupon he is said to be ours; and, as the consequence thereof,
we lay claim to those benefits which he has purchased for
us, as our Redeemer. Christ is considered as the first promised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>blessing in the covenant of grace; and <i>with him</i> God
<i>freely gives</i> his people <i>all things</i> that they stand in need of,
which respect their everlasting salvation, Rom. viii. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>This supposes the person receiving him to be indigent and
destitute of every thing that may tend to make him happy,
brought into the greatest straits and difficulties, and standing
in need of one who is able to afford relief to him. He has
heard in the gospel, that Christ is able to supply his wants;
and that he is willing to come and take up his abode with him;
accordingly the heart is open to embrace him, esteeming him
to be altogether lovely and desirable, beholding that excellency
and glory in his person, that renders him the object of his
delight, as he is said to be <i>precious to them that believe</i>, 1 Pet.
ii. 7. looking upon him as God-man Mediator, he concludes,
that he is able to save, to the uttermost, all that come unto
God by him; and that all the treasures of grace and glory are
purchased by him, and given into his hand to apply to those
who have an interest in him: he expects to find them all in
Christ, as the result of his being made partaker of him; and
accordingly he adheres to him by this which is called an appropriating
act of faith; whereby he that was before represented
in the gospel, as the Saviour and Redeemer of his people,
the fountain of all they enjoy or hope for, and by whom they
have access to God, as their reconciled God and Father, is applied
by the soul, to itself, as the spring of all its present and
future comfort and happiness.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>(2.) Another act of faith is giving up ourselves to Christ.
As, in the covenant of grace, God says, <i>I will be to them a
God, and they shall be to me a people</i>, faith builds on this foundation;
it first apprehends that he is able and willing to do
them good, and make them happy in the enjoyment of himself;
and with this encouragement the soul receives him, as
has been but now observed; and pursuant hereunto devotes itself
to him, as desiring to be amongst the number of his faithful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Servants and followers. God sanctifies or separates them
to himself as the objects of his discriminating grace and love;
and they desire, as the consequence hereof, to give up themselves
to him. Two things are supposed in this act of self-dedication.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, A firm persuasion and acknowledgment of his right to
us; not only as the possessor of all things, which he has an undoubted
right to as God, as the potter has a right to his clay,
the Creator to the work of his hands; but that he has a right
to us by purchase, as Mediator, in which respect faith, and in
particular, that which we call saving, of which we are now
speaking, has more especially an eye to him; <i>Ye are not your
own</i>, says the apostle, <i>for ye are bought with a price</i>, 1 Cor. vi.
20. and therefore this act of faith is an ascribing to him that
glory which he lays claim to by right of redemption: and as
God has constituted him heir of all things, more especially of
those who are called his peculiar treasure: so the believer gives
up himself to him. Before this, the matter in dispute was, who
is Lord over us? Whether we ought to be at our own disposal
or his? Whether it be expedient to serve divers lusts and
pleasures, or be subject to him as our supreme Lord and Lawgiver?
But the soul is thoroughly convinced, by the internal
efficacious work of the Spirit, that our great Mediator is made
of God, both Lord and Christ; and that no one has a right to
stand in competition with him; and that we owe not only what
we can do, but even ourselves unto him; and as the result
hereof, devotes itself to him by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d</i>, This also supposes that we are sensible of the many
blessings that he has in store for his people; and therefore we
give up ourselves to him in hope of his doing all that for us,
and working all that grace in us which is necessary to our salvation;
but more of this will be insisted on, when we consider
him as the object of trust. All that I shall add at present, under
this head, is, that having this view of the person of Christ,
as one who demands obedience, love and gratitude from us,
we give up ourselves entirely, and without reserve, to him:
thus the apostle says, <i>They first gave their own selves to the
Lord</i>, 2 Cor. viii. 5. and exhorts the church to <i>yield themselves
unto God, as those that were alive from the dead</i>, Rom. vi. 13.
and, to <i>present their bodies</i>, that is, themselves, and not barely
the lower or meaner part of themselves, <i>a living sacrifice, holy
and acceptable to God, which is their reasonable service</i>, chap.
xii. 1. and as the result hereof, we say by faith, Lord, truly I
am thy servant, and desire to be so for ever; work in me what
thou requirest, and then command what thou pleasest: I am
entirely at thy disposal, do with me as seemeth good in thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>sight; only let all the dispensations of thy providence be instances
of thy love, and made subservient to my salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is represented as our solemn act and deed; whereby,
with the most mature deliberation, we make a surrender of
ourselves to him: the prophet speaks of it as though it were
done by an instrument or deed of conveyance; and our consent
to be his, is represented by a giving up our names to him;
<i>One shall say, I am the Lord’s, and another shall call himself by
the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand
unto the Lord, and sirname himself by the name of Israel</i>, Isa.
xliv. 5. This is done with the highest veneration, as an act of
religious worship, and with the greatest humility, as being sensible
that we give him nothing more than his own; that he is
not profited hereby, but the advantage redounds entirely to us.
We do it with judgment; as faith always supposes a conviction
of the judgment, it considers those relations which Christ
stands in to his people, and endeavours to behave itself in conformity
thereunto: we are desirous hereby to give up ourselves
to him as a Prophet, to be led and guided by him in the way
of salvation; as a Priest, to give us a right to eternal life, as
the purchase of his blood; as an Advocate to plead our cause;
and as a King to give laws to us, and defend us from the insults
of our spiritual enemies, and advance us to those honours
which he has laid up for his faithful subjects. We give up ourselves
to him to worship him in all his ordinances, in hope of
his presence and blessing to attend them, in order to our spiritual
and eternal advantage; and we do all this without the
least reserve or desire to have any will separate from, or contrary
to his.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Another act of faith consists in a fixed, unshaken trust
and reliance upon him. This, as was before observed, is a very
common and known acceptation of the word <i>faith</i>. As we depend
on his promise, as a God that cannot lie, and give up ourselves
to him, as one that has a right to us; so we trust him, as
one whom we can safely confide in, and lay the whole stress of
our salvation upon. This act of faith is more frequently insisted
on in scripture than any other, it being a main ingredient in all
other graces that accompany salvation; and there is nothing by
which God is more glorified: it is not one single perfection of
the divine nature that is the object thereof; but every thing
which he has made known concerning himself, as conducive to
our blessedness; we trust him with all we have, and for all that
we want or hope for. This implies in it a sense of our own insufficiency
and nothingness, and of his all-sufficient fulness. The
former of these is what is sometimes styled a soul emptying
act of faith; it is that whereby we see ourselves to be nothing,
not only as we cannot be profitable to God, or lay him under any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>obligations to us, as those who pretend to merit any good at his
hand, but as unable to perform any good action without his assistance;
in this respect it says, <i>surely, in the Lord have I righteousness
and strength</i>, Isa. xlv. 24. and there is nothing tends
more to humble and abase the soul before him than this.</p>

<p class='c006'>And hereby we are led to another act, which more immediately
contains the formal nature of faith; in which it depends
on the all-sufficiency of God, and his faithfulness to supply our
wants, and bestow the blessings which he has promised: God
the Father is the object of this trust or dependence, as the divine
All-sufficiency is glorified, grace imparted, and the promises
thereof fulfilled by him, through a Mediator; and Christ
is the object thereof, as the soul apprehends him to be full of
grace and truth; sees the infinite value of his merit, and his
ability to make good all the promises of the covenant of grace,
and thereby to render him completely blessed. When we trust
Christ with all we have, or hope for, this supposes that there
is something valuable which we either enjoy or expect; and
that we are in danger of losing it, unless it be maintained by
him, who has undertaken to <i>keep</i> his people <i>by his power
through faith unto salvation</i>, 1 Pet. i. 5. and to perfect what
concerns them. We have souls more valuable than the whole
world, and we <i>commit the keeping of our souls to him in well-doing
as unto a faithful Creator</i>, chap. iv. 19. and merciful Redeemer;
being assured that <i>none shall</i> be able to <i>pluck them out
of his hand</i>, John x. 28. and we also commit all the graces which
he has wrought in us to him, to maintain and carry on to perfection.
And since we are assured, that all the promises are in
his hand, and that he has engaged to make them good to us, we
are encouraged to trust him for all that we expect, namely, that
he will conduct us safely and comfortably through this world,
and at last receive us to glory; and in so doing, we have the
highest satisfaction; or, as the apostle expresses it, <i>We know
whom we have believed</i>, or trusted, <i>and are persuaded that he
is able to keep what we have committed unto him against that
day</i>, 2 Tim. i. 12. or the day of his second coming, when grace
shall be consummate in glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>These acts of faith are generally styled, by divines, <i>direct</i>;
in which we have more immediately to do with Christ, as our
great Mediator, or God the Father in him; and being, properly
speaking, acts of religious worship, the object thereof must
be a divine person. But there is another sense of the word
<i>faith</i>; which, as it does not contain in it any act of trust or dependence,
as the former does, so it has not God for its immediate
object, as that has; and this is what we call the <i>reflex</i> act
of faith, or the soul’s being persuaded that it believes; that
those acts of faith which have God or Christ for their object,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>are true and genuine. This every one cannot conclude at all
times, who is really enabled to put forth those direct acts of
faith, that we have been speaking of; and it is the result of
self-examination, accompanied with the testimony of the Holy
Spirit to his own work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some indeed have questioned the propriety of the expression,
when this is styled an act of faith; as supposing that nothing
can be so called, but what hath a divine person for its
object: but we have before considered that faith, in a sense
different from that in which we have now explained it, may be
conversant about divine things; therefore, as we may be said,
by a direct act of faith, to trust in Christ; we may be persuaded,
by this reflex act, that we do so: and this is more immediately
necessary to assurance, together with that joy and peace
which we are said to have in believing. But this we shall have
occasion to insist on under a following answer.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We are now to consider this grace of faith as that which
accompanies salvation, upon which account it is called a <i>saving
grace</i>; and also, that it is wrought in the heart by the power
of the Spirit, and by the instrumentality of the word. We do
not suppose that every act of faith denominates a person to be
in a state of salvation; for there is a bare assent to the truth of
divine revelation, that may, in a proper sense, be styled <i>faith</i>;
and there may be an external dedication to God, a professed
subjection to him, which falls short of that faith which has been
before described, as it does not proceed from a renewed nature,
or a principle of spiritual life implanted in the soul. There may
be a willingness and a desire to be saved, when the heart is not
purified by faith; a hearing the word with gladness, rejoicing
in the light that is imparted thereby, for a season, and doing
many things pursuant thereunto, in some, who shall not be saved:
but faith is often-times described as referring to and ending
in salvation; thus we are said to <i>believe to the saving of the
soul</i>, Heb. x. 39. and, to <i>receive the end of our faith, even the
salvation of our souls</i>, 1 Pet. i. 9. This consists, more especially,
in those acts of faith, that contain in them an entire subjection
of all the powers and faculties of the soul to Christ,
arising from the views which it has of his glory, and its experience
of his almighty power, which is not only the way to,
but the first fruits of everlasting salvation. This is such a receiving
and resting on Christ for salvation, as has been before
described.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this grace is farther said to be wrought in the heart of
a sinner, by the Spirit. We have before considered effectual
calling, as a work of divine power, and proved, that the Spirit
is the author of it;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> and that they, who are effectually called,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>are enabled to accept of, and embrace the grace offered in the
gospel; from whence it is evident, that faith is the fruit and
consequence of our effectual calling; and therefore it must be
a work of the almighty power and grace of the Holy Spirit.
And, this it farther appears to be, from that account which we
have thereof in several scriptures: thus the apostle Peter, describing
those he writes to, as having <i>obtained like precious faith,
through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</i>;
and also as having <i>all things that pertain unto godliness</i>, in
which faith is certainly included, he ascribes this to the <i>divine
power</i>, 2 Pet. i. 1. compared with the 3rd verse. And elsewhere
we read <i>of the exceeding greatness of the power</i> of God
exerted <i>in them that believe</i>, Eph. i. 19. And when the work
of faith is carried on, or fulfilled in the souls of those in whom
it was begun, it is considered as an effect of the same power,
2 Thess. i. 11. And, as all that grace, which is the effect of divine
power, is ascribed to the Holy Ghost, when he is said
hereby, as acting in subserviency to the Father and Son, to demonstrate
his Personal glory: so the work of faith, in this respect,
is represented as his work; upon which account he is
called the <i>Spirit of faith</i>, 2 Cor, iv. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which we shall more particularly consider is, that
this grace of faith is wrought by the instrumentality of the
word. We have before observed, that the principle of grace,
implanted in regeneration, is the immediate effect of the divine
power, without the instrumentality of the word; but when the
Spirit works faith, and all other graces, which proceed from
that principle, then he makes use of the word: thus the apostle
says, <i>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
God</i>, Rom. x. 17. As it is necessary, in order to our seeing any
object, that the eye be rightly disposed and fitted for sight, and
the object presented to it: so there are two things necessary to
faith, namely, the soul’s being changed, renewed, quickened,
and so prepared to act this grace; and the objects being presented
to it, about which it is to be conversant; which latter is
done by the word of God: so that the soul is first internally
disposed to receive what God is pleased to reveal relating to the
way of salvation by Jesus Christ before it believes; and this revelation
is contained in the gospel, which is adapted to the various
acts of faith, as before described.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As faith implies a coming to Christ, or receiving him; the
word of God reveals him to us as giving an invitation to sinners,
encouraging them thereunto; thus our Saviour says, <i>If
any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink</i>, John vii. 37.
And, as a farther inducement to this, it sets forth the advantages
that will attend it, to wit, that he will not reject them,
how unworthy soever they be; as, he says, <i>Him that cometh to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>me, I will in no wise cast out</i>, John vi. 37. And there are many
other privileges which he will bestow on them, namely, the
blessings of both worlds, grace here, and glory hereafter, all
which contain the very sum and substance of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If we consider faith as including in it a giving up ourselves
to Christ, to be intirely his; the word of God represents him as
having an undoubted right to all who do so, inasmuch as they
are bought with the price of his blood, given to him as his own,
by the Father. And as they devote themselves to him, to be
his servants, it sets before them the privileges which attend his
service, as they are delivered from the dominion of sin, and a
servile fear and dread of his wrath; lets them know the ease,
pleasure, and delight that there is in bearing his yoke, and the
blessed consequences thereof, in that as they <i>have their fruit
unto holiness, the end thereof shall be life everlasting</i>, Rom.
vi. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. As faith looks to Christ for forgiveness of sin, in which
respect it is called justifying faith; so the word of God represents
him to us, as having made atonement for sin; as set forth
to be a propitiation to secure us from the guilt which we were
liable to, and the condemning sentence of the law; as bearing
the curse, and, as the consequence thereof, giving us a right to
all the privileges of his children. It also represents this forgiveness
as full, free, and irreversible; and the soul, by faith
rejoices in its freedom from condemnation, and that right and
title to eternal life, which is inseparably connected with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. As faith includes in it a trusting or relying on Christ, the
gospel represents him as an all-sufficient Saviour, <i>able to save
to the uttermost all that come unto God by him</i>, Heb. vii. 25.
and as faith trusts him for the accomplishment of all the promises,
it considers him as having engaged to make them good,
inasmuch as <i>they are yea and amen in him, unto the glory of
God</i>, 2 Cor. i. 20. And therefore, he runs no risque, or is at
no uncertainty as to this matter; for Christ’s Mediatorial glory
lies at stake. If there be the least failure in the accomplishment
of any promise; or any blessing made over to his people
in the covenant of grace, which shall not be conferred upon
them, he is content to bear the blame for ever: but this is altogether
impossible, since he that has undertaken to apply the
blessings promised, is faithful and true, as well as the Father
that gave them; and this affords them <i>strong consolation, who
are fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before them</i> in
the gospel, Heb. vi. 18. Thus Christ is set forth; and agreeably
to this discovery made of him, faith takes up its rest in
him, and therein finds safety and peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We shall now consider faith as strong or weak, increasing
or declining, with the various marks and signs thereof. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>habits of sin are stronger or weaker, the same may be said concerning
habits of grace. It is one thing for them to be entirely
lost; and another thing to be in a declining state: their strength
and vigour may be much abated, and their energy frequently
interrupted; nevertheless God will maintain the principle of
grace, as we shall endeavour to prove under a following answer.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
Grace is not always equally strong and lively; the prophet
supposes it to be a declining, when he says, <i>Revive thy
work, O Lord, in the midst of the years</i>, Heb. iii. 2. and our
Saviour’s advice to the church at Sardis, implies as much, when
he exhorts them <i>to strengthen the things which remain, that
are ready to die</i>, Rev. iii. 2. and when he bids the church at
Ephesus to <i>remember from whence they were fallen, and repent
and do their first works</i>, chap. ii. 5. Some are said, as Abraham,
to be <i>strong in faith, giving glory to God</i>, Rom. iv. 20.
and others are reproved, as our Saviour does his disciples, at
some times, when he says, <i>O ye of little faith</i>, Matt. vi. 30. As
our natural constitution is not always equally healthy and vigorous,
nor our condition in the world equally prosperous, the
same may be said concerning the habits of grace; sometimes
they are strong, and then, as the apostle says concerning his
beloved Gaius, 3 John ver. 2. <i>the soul prospereth</i>, and we <i>go
from strength to strength</i>, Psal. lxxxiv. 7. from one degree of
grace to another; but, at other times, we are ready to <i>faint in
the day of adversity</i>, and our <i>strength is small</i>, Prov. xxiv. 10.
This cannot but be observed by all who are not strangers to
themselves, or who take notice of the various frame of spirit,
which are visible in those whom they converse with.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if it be enquired; by what marks or evidences we may
discern the strength or weakness of faith? though this will
more evidently appear from what will be said under a following
answer,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> when we are led to speak concerning the reason
of the imperfection of sanctification in believers; yet we shall
not wholly pass it over in this place; and therefore, it may be
observed, that the strength or weakness of faith, is to be judged
of by that degree of esteem and value which the soul has
for Christ, and the steadiness, or abatement of its dependence
on him. The greater diffidence or distrust we have of self, and
the more we see of our own emptiness and nothingness, the
stronger is our faith; on the other hand, self-confidence, or
relying on our own strength is a certain sign of the weakness
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, strong faith is that which carries the soul through
difficult duties; as the apostle says, <i>I can do all things through
Christ which strengtheneth me</i>, Phil. iv. 13. Whereas weak
faith is ready to sink under the discouragements that it meets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>with; the former is <i>stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in
the work of the Lord</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 58. the latter is like a reed shaken
with the wind. Strong faith, as it is said of Job, Job i. 21.
blesses God when he strips him of all earthly enjoyments, and
rejoices that the soul is <i>counted worthy to suffer shame for his
name</i>, Acts v. 41. and this carries him above those fears which
have a tendency to deject and dishearten him: <i>He shall not be
afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord</i>,
Psal. cxii. 7. Whereas, weak faith is borne down, with discouragements;
he finds it hard to hold on in the performance
of his duty, and sees mountains of difficulties in his way;
whereby the soul is ready to conclude, that he shall not be able
to get safely to his journey’s end. He does not rightly improve
the consideration of the almighty power of God, and his faithfulness
to his promise, in which he has engaged, that <i>the righteous
shall hold on his way; and he that hath clean hands shall
wax stronger and stronger</i>, Job xvii. 9. And when we sustain
losses and disappointments in the world, or things go contrary
to our expectation, then we are ready to say with the Psalmist,
<i>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he, in anger, shut up
his tender mercies?</i> Psal. lxxvii. 9. and sometimes conclude,
that we have no interest in the love of God, because the dispensations
of his providence are afflictive, and fill us with great
uneasiness. In this case fear looks upon every adverse providence,
as it were, through a magnifying glass, and apprehends
this to be but the beginning of sorrows; for it cannot say with
the prophet, <i>I will trust and not be afraid</i>, chap. xii. 2. <i>for in
the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength</i>, chap. xxvii. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the strength or weakness of faith may farther be
discerned by our enjoying, or being destitute of communion
with God; our conversing with him in ordinances, or being
deprived of this privilege. We may conclude our faith to be
strong, when we can say as the apostle does, <i>Our conversation
is in heaven</i>, or we live above: but when, on the other hand,
we have too great an anxiety or solicitude about earthly things,
and an immoderate love to this present world, this argues the
weakness thereof. The difference between these two may also
be discerned, by the frame of our spirit in prayer. When faith
is strong, the soul has a great degree of boldness or liberty of
access to the throne of grace; a greater measure of importunity
and fervency, accompanied with an expectation of the blessings
prayed for, by a secret and powerful intimation from the
Spirit, as a Spirit of grace and supplication; from whence it
infers, that he that excites this grace will encourage it, as he
<i>says not to the seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain</i>, chap. xlv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also add, in the last place, that strong faith may
likewise be discerned, when it is accompanied with an assurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of an interest in Christ’s righteousness, and our right and
title to eternal life founded thereon, or that God will guide us
by his counsel, and afterwards receive us to glory, and a persuasion
wrought in the soul by the Spirit, that nothing shall separate
us from his love: whereas weak faith is attended with
many doubts concerning our interest in Christ; sometimes
fearing that our former hope was no other than a delusion, our
present experiences not real, the ground we stand on sinks under
us; and we are ready to conclude, that we shall one day
fall by the hands of our spiritual enemies. When I speak of
these doubts and fears, as an instance of weak faith, I do not
say that they are ingredients in faith; for they are rather to be
considered as a burden and incumbrance that attends it, so that
though there be some good thing in us towards the Lord our
God, or a small degree of faith, like a grain of mustard seed,
these doubts proceed from the weakness thereof, as opposed to
that which is strong, and would denote the soul to be in a happy
and flourishing condition; which leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. To speak concerning the use of faith in the whole conduct
of our lives; as every thing that we do in an acceptable
manner, is said to be done by it. It is one thing occasionally
to put forth some acts of faith, and another thing to live by
faith; which, as it is the most noble and excellent life, so nothing
short of it can, properly speaking, be called a good life,
how much soever many are styled good livers, who are wholly
strangers to this grace. The apostle Paul speaks of this way
of living, and considers it as exemplified in himself, when he
says, <i>The life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith
of the Son of God</i>, Gal. ii. 20. He speaks of it as his constant
work, or that which ran through the whole business of life.
Whether we are engaged in civil or religious duties, they are
all to be performed by faith. Here we shall consider the life
of faith;</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As it discovers itself in all the common actions of life;
in these we act as men: but that faith, which is the principal
ingredient in them, and their chief ornament, denotes us to
walk as Christians; and this we are said to do,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) When we receive every outward mercy, as the purchase
of the blood of Christ, as well as the gift of his grace;
and consider it as a blessing bestowed by a covenant-God,
who, together with outward things, is pleased to give himself
to us; which infinitely enhances the value of the blessing, and
induces us to receive it with a proportionable degree of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When we set loose from all the enjoyments of this world,
not taking up our rest in them, as though they were our portion
or chief good; and therefore, the esteem and value we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>have for them is very much below that which we have for
things divine and heavenly. When we use them to the glory
of God; and account the best outward enjoyments nothing, if
compared with Christ; as the apostle says, <i>I count all things
but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and do
count them but dung, that I may win Christ</i>, Phil. iii. 8. This
act of faith will quiet our spirits under afflictions, and induce
us to submit to the disposing providence of God; when our
best outward enjoyments are removed, or we called to suffer
the loss of all things for Christ’s sake, or by his sovereign will.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) When all the success which we hope for in our secular
employments, is considered as an instance of that care which
Christ takes of his people, in which he over-rules and orders
all things for his own glory, and their welfare; and therefore,
we are persuaded that he will cause whatever we take in hand,
to prosper, provided he sees that it is best for us; and if not,
we are disposed to acquiesce in his will. This is such an instance
of faith as will put us upon doing every thing in the
name and to the glory of Christ, and fortify us against any
disappointment that may attend our expectation, in every employment
wherein we are engaged.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) When outward blessings, instead of proving a snare and
temptation, to draw off our hearts from Christ, are a means to
bring us nearer to him, so that if our circumstances are easy
and comfortable in the world, and we have more frequent opportunities
offered to us, to engage in religious duties than
others, we are accordingly inclined to embrace them; and
when every thing we enjoy, as an instance of distinguishing
favour from God, above what many in the world do, excites
in us a due sense of gratitude, and an earnest desire and endeavour
to use the world to his glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) When adverse providences, which sometimes have a
tendency to drive the soul from Christ, and occasion repining
thoughts, as though the divine distributions were not equal,
are made of use to bring us nearer to him, so that whatever
we lose in the creature, we look for, and endeavour to find in
him. And when, with a submissive spirit, we can say, that he
does all things well for us, as we hope and trust that he will
make even those things that run counter to our secular interests,
subservient to our eternal welfare; and as the result hereof, endeavour
to keep up a becoming frame of spirit, in such a condition
of life, as has in itself a tendency to cast down the soul
and fill it with great disquietude.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) When we devote and consecrate all we have in the
world to God, considering, that as we are not our own but
his; so all we have is his; and when hereupon we are endowed
with a public spirit, desirous to approve ourselves blessings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to mankind in general, to the utmost of our power; and when
we have done all, not only say with David, <i>Of thine own we
have given thee</i>, 1 Chron. xxix. 14. but as our Saviour taught
his disciples to say, <i>We are unprofitable servants</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) The life of faith discovers itself in the government of
our affections, namely, as they are kept within due bounds,
set upon right objects, and rendered subservient to promote
Christ’s glory and interest. Hereby are we prevented from
setting our affections immoderately on things of this world,
when faith shews us that there are far better things to draw
them forth, which deserve our highest love: it also prevents
our being worldly and carnal, as though we were swallowed
up with the things of sense, and had nothing else to mind, and
religion were only to be occasionally engaged in; or, as though
an holy, humble, self-denying frame of spirit were inconsistent
with worldly business. Faith suggests the contrary; puts us
upon making religion our great business, and engaging in secular
affairs, rather as a necessary avocation from it, than that
which is the chief end of living. It also puts us upon glorifying
Christ in our secular concerns, as we manage them in such
a way as he ordains; and hereby the soul is kept in a spiritual
frame, while abiding with God in the calling whereunto he is
called. This we attribute more especially to the grace of faith,
not only as it is connected with, and (as will be observed under
our next head) excites other graces; but as it has its eye
constantly fixed on Christ as its object, and by this steers its
course, and takes an estimate of the valuableness and importance
of all the affairs of this life, by their subserviency to our
salvation, and the advancement of his glory therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Faith discovers itself in the performance of all religious
duties, and the exercise of all other graces therein. Thus we
read of the prayer of faith, whereby a soul hath access to God
as a father, in the name of Christ; firmly relies on the promises
which are established in him, and has a liberty to plead with
him, and hope of acceptance in his sight. Moreover, when we
wait on God to hear what he has to impart to us in his word,
faith having experienced some degree of communion with him
already, and had some displays of his love, puts the soul upon
desiring more, as the Psalmist says, <i>My soul thirsteth for thee;
my flesh longeth for thee, to see thy power and thy glory, so as
I have seen thee in the sanctuary</i>, Psal. lxiii. 1, 2. And whatever
other ordinances of divine appointment, we are engaged
in, we are hereby encouraged to hope for his presence, and
draw nigh unto him herein, with a reverential fear and delight,
in him: and it puts us upon the exercise of those graces which
are necessary for the right performance of gospel worship in
general.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>These are not only joined with it, but may be said to be
excited thereby; so that faith is, as it were, the principal of
all other graces. Thus when the heart is drawn forth in love
to Christ, it may be said, that <i>faith worketh by love</i>, Gal. v.
6. and when this love is accompanied with <i>joy unspeakable and
full of glory</i>; this we have in a way of believing, and that
which tends to excite the grace of love, is the view that faith
takes of Christ’s mediatorial glory and excellencies, and the
obligations we are under to love him, from his grace of love
to us; and this is a strong motive, inducing us to express our
love to him, by universal obedience, which is called, <i>the obedience
of faith</i>, Rom. xvi. 26.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we exercise the grace of repentance, and thereby hate
and turn from all sin, and are, in a peculiar manner, sensible,
as we ought to be, of the sin of unbelief; it is faith that gives
us this sense thereof, as it is best able to see its own defects.
When we confess sin, or humble ourselves before God for it,
faith views it not only as a violation of the divine law, but as
an instance of the highest ingratitude; and when we desire, in
the exercise of repentance, to forsake sin, faith makes us sensible
of our own weakness, and puts us upon a firm and stedfast
dependence on Christ, to enable us thereunto; and when,
in the exercise of this grace, our consciences are burdened
with a sense of guilt and unbelief is ready to suggest, that our
sins are so heinously aggravated, that there is no room to hope
for pardoning mercy, faith relieves us against these despairing
thoughts, and encourages us to wait for the mercy of God, who
will <i>abundantly pardon</i>, Isa. lv. 7. and with whom there is
<i>forgiveness, that he may be feared</i>, Psal. cxxx. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when we use endeavours to mortify sin, this is to be
done by a fiducial view of Christ crucified; and when we encourage
ourselves to hope that the indictment brought against
us for it, was nailed to the cross of Christ; and that there is
<i>no condemnation to us</i>, as being in him, Rom. viii. 1. and that,
as the apostle says, <i>Our old man is crucified with him, that the
body of sin might be destroyed: that henceforth we should no
longer serve sin</i>, chap. vi. 6. all this is to be done by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also observe, that the grace of patience is connected
with, and we excited, thereunto by faith. The apostle,
Heb. vi. 12. joins both these together, as supposing that
faith affords a motive to patience; and elsewhere we read, not
only of what faith enables us to do, but bear, in the account
which we have, of the great things which the Old Testament
saints did, and suffered by this grace: and therefore, whatever
graces are exercised under the afflictions of this present
life; faith excites in us a resignation to the will of God, and
consider them as the chastisements of a merciful Father, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>as <i>bringing forth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them
that are exercised thereby</i>, chap. xii. 11. and we are encouraged
to bear them with such a composed frame of spirit that they
seem light, and not worthy to be compared with the glory that
shall be revealed. This, faith has constantly in view, setting
one against the other; whereby that which would otherwise be
an hindrance to us in our way, is improved, by us, to our
spiritual advantage; and we enabled, not only to go on safely,
but comfortably, till we arrive at the full fruition of what we
now behold at a distance, and rejoice in the fiducial expectation
thereof: which leads us to the last thing proposed to be
considered, concerning faith, namely,</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. How it is to be attained or increased, and what are
the means conducive thereunto. Though faith, in common
with all other graces, be wrought in us by the power of God,
yet we are far from asserting, that there is no duty incumbent
on us, in the performing whereof, we are to hope and wait
for the divine blessing, upon which all the success thereof depends.
To deny this would give just occasion to charge the
doctrine of efficacious grace, as though it led to security, or
licentiousness; which many do without ground. Though grace
and duty are very distinct, yet they are not inconsistent with
each other; the former is God’s work, the latter our act.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those duties which are required of us, considered as
expecting the divine grace and blessing to attend them; these
are, a diligent waiting on God in all his ordinances; looking
into the state of our souls, by impartial self-examination; calling
to mind our past miscarriages, and what matter of humiliation
we have for them in the sight of God, as also, our
natural aversion and inability to do what is good; our need of
Christ’s righteousness, to take away the guilt we have contracted,
and of his strength, to subdue our corruptions, and
enable us to plead earnestly with him for these privileges.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the unregenerate, they must pray and wait on him,
for the first grace, and say, with Ephraim, <i>Turn thou me, and
I shall be turned</i>, Jer. xxxi. 18. They must be earnest with
him, that he would bestow upon them the grace of faith; which
is styled, his gift; that he would remove every thing that is,
at present, an obstacle, or hindrance to this grace, all the prejudices
which corrupt nature has entertained against Christ,
and the way of salvation by him; and that he would shine into
their souls, to give them the knowledge of his glory in the
face of Christ; reveal his arm, and incline them, by the internal
working of his power, to receive the grace which is held
forth in the gospel. These are duties incumbent on persons
who are not called effectually, being destitute of regenerating
grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>But, on the other hand, they who have ground to conclude
that they have experienced this grace, though, at present, they
apprehend that their faith is weak, and on the decline; they
must be found waiting on God, in his own way; and be importunate
with him in prayer for the revival of his work, that
so they may recover their former experiences; they must bless
him for the privileges they once enjoyed, and be humbled for
their past backslidings, whereby they have provoked him to
withdraw from them, and say with the church, <i>I will go and
return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than
now</i>, Hos. ii. 7. and, as it says elsewhere, <i>Take away all iniquity,
and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves
of our lips</i>, chap. xiv. 2. They must lament the dishonour
that they have brought to God; and consider how, by this
means, they have grieved the Holy Spirit, wounded their own
consciences, and made work for a bitter repentance and humiliation
before God. They must be sensible, that it is the same
hand which wrought grace in them at first, that must now recover
them from their fallen state, and, by exciting the principle
of grace implanted, bring them into a lively frame; and
when he has done this, they must still depend upon him to
maintain this frame of spirit, as considering that as the beginning
so the progress of grace, is owing to him who is the author
and finisher of faith; who worketh in us that which is
pleasing in his sight, and carries on his own work unto perfection.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXIV.</span> <i>What is adoption?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Adoption is an act of the free grace of God, in and for
his only Son Jesus Christ; whereby all those that are justified,
are received into the number of his children, have his
name put upon them, the Spirit of his Son given to them,
are under his fatherly care and dispensations, admitted to
all the liberties and privileges of the sons of God, made heirs
of all the promises, and fellow-heirs with Christ in glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>In speaking to this answer we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The various senses in which persons are the sons of
God; and particularly, how they are so called by adoption.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The difference between adoption as used by men, and as
it is applied in this answer to God’s taking persons into this relation,
as his children; from whence it will appear to be an act
of his free grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We shall consider the reference the sonship of believers
has to the superior and more glorious Sonship of Jesus Christ;
and how it is said to be for his sake.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>IV. The privileges conferred on, or reserved for them, who
are the sons of God by adoption.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider the various senses in which persons are
called the sons of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some are called the sons of God, as they are invested
with many honours or prerogatives from God, as a branch of
his image: thus magistrates are called the <i>children of the Most
High</i>, Psal. lxxxii. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Others are called God’s children, by an external federal
relation, as members of the visible church; in which sense we
are to understand that scripture; wherein it is said, <i>The sons
of God saw the daughters of men</i>, &amp;c. Gen. vi. 2. And when
Moses went into Pharaoh, to demand liberty for the Israelites,
he was ordered to say, <i>Israel is my son, even my first-born</i>,
Exod. iv. 22. This privilege, though it be high and honourable,
by which the church is distinguished from the world; yet
it is not inseparably connected with salvation; for God says,
concerning Israel, when revolting, and backsliding from him,
<i>I have nourished and brought up children; and they have rebelled
against me</i>, Isa. i. 2. and many of those who are called
the <i>children of the kingdom shall be cast into utter darkness,
where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth</i>, Matt. viii. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The word is sometimes taken in a more large sense, as
applicable to all mankind: thus the prophet says, <i>Have we not
all one father, hath not God created us?</i> Mal. ii. 10. And the
apostle Paul, when disputing with the Athenians, speaks in
their own language, and quotes a saying taken from one of
their poets, which he applies to the great God, as <i>giving to all
life and breath, and all things</i>; upon which account men are
called his <i>off-spring</i>, Acts xvii. 25. compared with 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. They are called the sons of God, who are endowed with
his supernatural image, and admitted to the highest honours
and privileges conferred upon creatures: thus the angels are
called the <i>sons of God</i>, Job xxxviii. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Our Lord Jesus Christ is called the Son of God, in a
sense not applicable to any other; as his Sonship includes in it
his deity, and his having, in his human nature, received a commission
from the Father, to engage in the great work of our
redemption, as becoming surety for us; which is the foundation
of all those saving blessings which we enjoy or hope for.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Believers are called the sons of God, by a special adoption;
which is farther to be considered, as being the subject-matter
of this answer. Adoption is a word taken from the
civil law; and it was much in use among the Romans, in the
apostles time, in which it was a custom for persons, who had
no children of their own, and were possessed of an estate, to
prevent its being divided or descending to strangers, to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>choice of such who were agreeable to them, and beloved by
them, whom they took into this political relation of children;
obliging them to take their name upon them, and to pay respect
to them, as though they were their natural parents; and engaging
to deal with them as though they had been so; and accordingly
to give them a right to their estates, as an inheritance.
This new relation, founded in a mutual consent, is a
bond of affection; and the privilege arising from thence is, that
he who is, in this sense, a father, takes care of, and provides
for the person whom he adopts, as though he were his son by
nature; and therefore Civilians calls it an act of legitimation,
imitating nature, or supplying the place of it: and this leads us
to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The difference between adoption, as used by men, and
as it is applied in this answer, to God’s taking persons into
this relation, as his children.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When men adopt, or take persons into the relation of
children, they do it because they are destitute of children of
their own to possess their estates; and therefore they fix their
love on strangers: but God was under no obligation to do this:
for if he designed to manifest his glory to any creatures, the
holy angels were subjects capable of receiving the displays
thereof; and his own Son, who had all the perfections of the
divine nature, was infinitely the object of his delight, and, in
all respects, fitted to be as he is styled, <i>Heir of all things</i>,
Heb. i. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When men adopt, they are generally inclined to do it by
seeing some excellency or amiableness in the persons whom
they fix their love upon. Thus Pharaoh’s daughter took up
Moses, and nourished him for her own son, because he was
<i>exceeding fair</i>, Acts vii. 20, 21. or, it may be, she was moved
hereunto, by a natural compassion she had for him, besides
the motive of his beauty; as it is said, <i>The babe wept, and she
had compassion on him</i>, Exod. ii. 6. And Mordecai adopted
Esther, or took her for his own daughter; <i>for she was his uncle’s
daughter, and was fair and beautiful</i>, and an orphan, <i>having
neither father nor mother</i>, Esther ii. 7. But when God takes
any into this relation of children, they have no beauty or comeliness,
and might justly have been for ever the objects of his
abhorrance. Thus he says concerning the church of Israel,
when he first took them into this relation to him, <i>None eye
pitied thee, but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the loathing
of thy person: and when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted
in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy
blood, Live</i>, &amp;c. Ezek. xvi. 5. It might indeed be said concerning
man, when admitted to this favour and privilege, that
he was miserable; but misery, how much soever it may render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the soul an object of pity, it could not, properly speaking,
be said to be a motive or inducement from whence the divine
compassion took its first rise, as appears from the account we
have of the mercy of God, as founded only on his sovereign
will or pleasure; as he says, <i>I will have mercy on whom I will
have mercy; and I will have compassion on whom I will have
compassion</i>, Rom. ix. 15. and also, from the consideration of
man’s being exposed to misery by sin, which rendered him
rather an object of vindictive justice than mercy. This therefore
cannot be the ground of God’s giving him a right to an
inheritance; and consequently adoption is truly said, in this answer,
to be an act of the free grace of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When men adopt, their taking persons into the relation
of children, is not necessarily attended with any change of disposition
or temper in the persons adopted. A person may be
admitted to this privilege, and yet remain the same, in that respect,
as he was before: but when God takes his people into
the relation of children, he gives them, not only those other
privileges which arise from thence, but also that temper and
disposition that becomes those who are thus related to him.
This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The reference which the sonship of believers has to the
superior and more glorious Sonship of Jesus Christ; and how
it is said to be for his sake. Here we must suppose that there
is a sense in which Christ is said to be the Son of God, as the
result of the divine decree, which contains in it an idea very
distinct from his being a divine person; for that was not the
result of the will of the Father; whereas it is said concerning
him, <i>I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou
art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</i>, Psal. ii. 7. And elsewhere,
<i>he hath, by inheritance, obtained a more excellent name
than</i> the angels; and this is the consequence of God’s saying
to him, <i>thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</i>: and, <i>I
will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son</i>, Heb. i. 4, 5.
which plainly refers to Christ as Mediator. Now when we consider
this mediatorial Sonship of Christ, if I may so express it,
we are far from asserting, that Christ’s Sonship, and that of believers,
is of the same kind; for, as much as he exceeds them
as Mediator, as to the glory of his person and office, so much
is his Sonship superior to theirs. This being premised, we may
better understand the reference which the sonship of believers
has to Christ’s being the Son of God as Mediator; and therefore
let it be farther considered,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>1. That it is a prerogative and glory of Christ, as the Son of
God, that he has all things which relate to the salvation of his
elect, put into his hand; and therefore, whatever the saints enjoy
or hope for, which is sometimes called in scripture their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>inheritance, agreeably to their character, as the children of
God by adoption; this is considered as first purchased by
Christ, and then put into his hand; in which respect it is styled
his inheritance, he being constituted, pursuant to his having
accomplished the work of redemption, heir of all things;
and as such, has not only a right to his people, but is put in
possession of all those spiritual blessings in heavenly places,
wherewith they are <i>blessed in him</i>, Eph. i. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. From hence it follows, that the sonship of believers, and
their right to that inheritance, which God has reserved for
them, depends upon the sonship of Christ, which is infinitely
more glorious and excellent. As God’s adopted sons, they have
the honour conferred upon them, of being <i>made kings and
priests</i> to him, Rev. i. 6. These honours are conferred by
Christ; and, in order thereunto, they are first given to him to
bestow upon them: thus he says, <i>I appoint unto you a kingdom,
as my Father hath appointed unto me</i>, Luke xxii. 29.
Christ is first appointed heir of all things, as Mediator; and
then his people, or his children, are considered as <i>heirs of God</i>,
as the apostle expresses it; <i>and joint heirs with Christ</i>, Rom.
viii. 17. Not that they have any share in his personal or mediatorial
glory; but when they are styled <i>joint-heirs</i> with him,
we must consider them as having a right to that inheritance,
which he is possessed of in their name as Mediator: and in
this sense we are to understand those scriptures that speak of
God’s being first the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and
then, to wit, in him our Father; accordingly he says, <i>I ascend
unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your
God</i>, John xx. 17. And elsewhere, God is styled <i>the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, and then <i>the Father of mercies</i>, or,
our merciful Father, 2 Cor. i. 3. And elsewhere the apostle
says, <i>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings, in heavenly places,
in Christ; having predestinated us unto the adoption of
children, by Jesus Christ, to himself</i>, Eph. i. 3. compared with 5.
and inasmuch as he designed to <i>bring many sons to glory</i>, as
being <i>made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light</i>; he first <i>made the captain of their salvation perfect
through sufferings</i>, Heb. ii. 10. compared with Col. i. 12. In
this respect our right to the inheritance of children, is founded
in the eternal purpose of God, relating hereunto, and the purchase
of Christ, as having obtained this inheritance for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We are now to consider the privileges conferred on, or
reserved for them who are the sons of God by adoption. These
are summed up in a very comprehensive expression, which
contains an amazing display of divine grace; as it is said, <i>He
that overcometh, shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and he shall be my son</i>, Rev. xxi. 7. It is a very large grant
that God is pleased to make to them; they shall inherit all
things. God is not ashamed to be called their God; and in
having him, they are said to possess all things, which are eminently
and transcendently in him; they have a right to all the
blessings which he had designed for, and which have a tendency
to make them completely happy: in this sense we are
to understand our Saviour’s words in the parable; <i>Son, thou
art ever with me, and all that I have is thine</i>, Luke xv. 31.
Nothing greater than this can be desired or enjoyed by creatures,
whom the Lord delights to honour. But, that we may
be a little more particular in considering the privileges which
God confers on, or has reserved for his children, it may be
farther observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That they are all emancipated, or freed from the slavery
which they were before under, either to sin or Satan; they who
were once the <i>servants of sin, are</i> hereby <i>made free from sin,
and become the servants of righteousness</i>, or become <i>servants to
God</i>, Rom. vi. 17, 18, 22. <i>have their fruit unto holiness, and
the end everlasting life; the Son makes them free</i>; and therefore
<i>they are free indeed</i>, John viii. 36. Before this they are
described as <i>serving divers lusts and pleasures</i>, Tit. iii. 3. and
are said to be <i>of their father the devil</i>, and to <i>do his works</i>, or
follow his suggestions, John viii. 44. ensnared, and <i>taken captive
by him at his will</i>, 2 Tim. ii. 26. and, as the consequence
hereof, are in perpetual bondage, arising from a dread of the
wrath of God, and that <i>fear of death</i> impressed on their spirits,
by him, who is said to have the <i>power of death</i>, Heb. ii. 14.
this they are delivered from, which cannot but be reckoned a
glorious privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They have God’s name put upon them, and accordingly
are described as <i>his people called by his name</i>, 2 Chron. vii. 14.
This is an high and honourable character, denoting their relation
to him as a peculiar people; and it is what belongs to
them alone. Thus the church says, <i>We are thine; thou never
bearest rule over them</i>, Isa. lxiii. 19. namely, thine adversaries;
<i>they were not called by thy name</i>. They have also Christ’s name
put on them, <i>of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is
named</i>, Eph. iii. 15. which not only signifies that propriety
which he has in them as Mediator, but their relation to him as
the ransomed of the Lord, his sheep, whom he leads and feeds
like a shepherd; and they are also styled his children, <i>Behold
I and the children which God hath given me</i>, Heb. ii. 13. and indeed,
when he is called a surety, or an advocate, or said to execute
certain offices as a Saviour or Redeemer; these are all relative
terms; and whatever he does therein, is in their name, and
for their advantage; as it is said, <i>of him are ye in Christ Jesus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
and redemption</i>, 1 Cor. i. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They are taken into God’s family, and dealt with as members
thereof; and accordingly are styled <i>fellow citizens with
the saints, and of the household of God</i>, Eph. ii. 19. And as the
consequence hereof, they have protection, provision, and communion
with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) They have safe protection; as the master of a family
thinks himself obliged to secure and defend from danger, all
that are under his roof, whose house is, as it were, their castle;
so Christ is his people’s defence, concerning whom it is
said, <i>A man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, and as
the shadow of a great rock in a weary land</i>, Isa. xxxii. 2. and, as
the consequence hereof, it is added, <i>My people shall dwell in a
peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting
places</i>, ver. 18. <i>They dwell on high; their place of defence is the
munition of rocks</i>, chap. xxxii. 16. He who has subdued their
enemies, and will in his own time, bruise them under their feet,
will take care that they shall not meet with that disturbance
from them, which may hinder their repose or rest in him, or
render their state unsafe, so as to endanger their perishing or
falling from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They enjoy the plentiful provisions of God’s house, and
therefore Christ is called their <i>shepherd</i>, Psal. xxiii. 1. not only
as leading and defending them, but as providing for them; <i>He
shall feed his flock like a shepherd</i>, Isa. xl. 11. As all grace is
treasured up in him, and there is a fulness thereof, which he
has to impart to the heirs of salvation, that is sufficient to supply
all their wants; so they shall never have a reason to complain
that they are straitened in him; the blessings of his house
are not only exhilirating, but satisfying, and such as have a tendency
to make them completely happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They are admitted to the greatest intimacy, and have
sweet communion with Christ; <i>the secret of the Lord is with
them that fear him</i>, Psal. xxv. 14. he deals with them as with
friends, and in this instance in particular, (as he tells his disciples,)
that <i>all that he has heard of the Father</i>, John xv. 15. that
is, whatever he had a commission to impart for their direction
and comfort, he <i>makes known unto them</i>, which must needs be
reckoned a very great privilege. As the queen of Sheba, when
beholding the advantages that they who were in Solomon’s presence
enjoyed, could not but with an extasy of admiration, say,
<i>Happy are thy men; happy are thy servants, which stand continually
before thee, that hear thy wisdom</i>, 1 Kings x. 8. much
more may they be happy who are admitted into his presence,
in whom <i>are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge</i>,
Col. ii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>(4.) Another privilege which they enjoy, is access to God,
as a reconciled Father, through Christ; they have a liberty to
<i>come boldly to the throne of grace, that they obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need</i>, Heb. iv. 18. Whatever their
straits and difficulties are, God holds forth his golden sceptre,
invites them to come to him, asks, What is thy petition? and
gives them ground to hope that it shall be granted, so far as it
may redound to his glory and their good. And, inasmuch as
they are often straitened in their spirits, and unprepared to
draw nigh to him; they have the promise of the Spirit to assist
them herein; upon which account he is called the <i>Spirit of
adoption, whereby they cry Abba Father</i>, Rom. viii. 15. This
privilege is said to be a consequence of their being sons; <i>Because
ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts, crying, Abba Father</i>, Gal. iv. 6. By this means
they have becoming conceptions of the Divine Majesty, a reverential
fear of, and a love to him, earnest desires of communion
with him, and of being made partakers of what he has
to impart. They have a right to plead the promises; and in
so doing, are encouraged to hope for the blessings contained
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) As God’s children are prone to backslide from him,
and so have need of restoring grace, he will recover and humble
them, and thereby prevent their total apostacy: this he
sometimes does by afflictions, which the apostle calls fatherly
chastisements, and reckons them not only consistent with, but
evidences of his love: <i>Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth;
and if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards, and not sons</i>, Heb. xii. 6, 8, 11. The apostle
does not here speak of afflictions as considered absolutely in
themselves, but as proceeding from the love of God, the design
whereof is to do them good; and as they are adapted to this
present state, in which they are training up for the glorious inheritance
reserved for them in heaven, and need some trying
dispensations, which may put them in mind of that state of perfect
blessedness which is laid up for them: and they are rendered
subservient to their present and future advantage, as the
afflictions of this present time <i>bring forth the peaceable fruits
of righteousness</i> to them; and when they are, in the end, perfectly
freed from them, will tend to enhance their joy and
praise; which leads us to consider another privilege, which is
so great that it crowns all those that they are now possessed
of, namely,</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) They shall, at last, be brought into God’s immediate
presence, and satisfied with his likeness. The apostle calls the
perfect blessedness of the saints, when raised from the dead,
and so delivered from the bondage of corruption, and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>partakers of the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, by way of
eminency, <i>the adoption, to wit, the redemption of their bodies</i>;
which signifies not only the full manifestation of their adoption,
but their taking possession of their inheritance, which they
are now waiting and hoping for, which is too great for the heart
of man to conceive of in this present state; for the apostle says,
<i>Now are we the sons of God; and it doth not appear what we
shall be: but we know, that when he shall appear we shall be
like him; for we shall see him as he is</i>, 1 John iii. 2. So that all
the blessings which we have, either in hand or hope, the blessings
of both worlds, which are conferred upon us from our first
conversion to our glorification: these are privileges which God
bestows on those who are his adopted children.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning adoption, we may take
occasion to observe, how, in some respects it agrees with, or
may indeed, be reckoned a branch of justification, and in other
respects it includes in it something that is an ingredient in sanctification.
We have before observed, in treating on the former
of these, <i>viz.</i> justification, that when God forgives sin, he confers
on his people a right to life, or to all the blessings of the
covenant of grace, in which are contained the promises that belong
to the life that now is, and that which is to come. These
are the privileges which God’s adopted children are made partakers
of; and in this respect some divines suppose, that adoption
is included in our justification.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And if justification be explained, as has been before observed,
as denoting an immanent act in God, whereby the elect
are considered, in the covenant between the Father and the
Son, as in Christ, their federal head; so they are considered as
the adopted children of God, in Christ, and accordingly as they
are described as chosen in Christ, unto eternal life, they are
said to be <i>predestinated unto the adoption of children</i>, Eph. i.
6. which is a privilege to be obtained by Jesus Christ: in this
respect all the elect are called Christ’s <i>seed, that shall serve
him</i>, Psal. xxii. 30. whom he had a special regard to, when he
made his soul an offering for sin, and concerning whom he had
this promise made to him in the covenant, that passed between
the Father and him, <i>that he should see them, and the pleasure of
the Lord</i>, with respect to their everlasting salvation, <i>should
prosper in his hand</i>, Isa. liii. 10. Now when Christ is considered
as the head of the elect, who are in this sense called his
sons, whom he has engaged to bring to glory, faith is the fruit
and consequence of adoption; accordingly the apostle says,
<i>Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father</i>, Gal. iv. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as justification is a declared act, and is said to be by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>faith, so adoption agreeing with it, is of the same nature; and
accordingly we are said to be the <i>children of God by faith</i>, chap.
iii. 26. that is, it is by faith that we have a right to claim this
relation, together with the privileges which are the result thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as adoption includes in it a person’s being made
meet for the inheritance, which God has reserved for him, and
so is endowed with the temper and disposition of his children,
consisting in humility, heavenly-mindedness, love to him, dependence
upon him, and a zeal for his glory, a likeness to
Christ; as the same mind is said to be in us, in some measure
as was in him; in this respect adoption agrees with sanctification,
which is what we are next to consider.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-75' class='c003'>Quest. LXXV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXV.</span> <i>What is sanctification?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Sanctification is a work of God’s grace, whereby they
whom God hath, before the foundation of the world, chosen
to be holy, are in time, through the powerful operation
of his Spirit, applying the death and resurrection of Christ
unto them, renewed in their whole man, after the image of
God, having the seeds of repentance unto life, and of all
other saving graces put into their hearts; and those graces
so stirred up, increased and strengthened, as that they more
and more die unto sin, and rise unto newness of life.</p>

<p class='c012'>1. We shall shew what we are to understand by the word
<i>sanctify</i>. This is sometimes considered as what has
God for its object: thus he is said to <i>sanctify himself</i>, when
he appears in the glory of his holiness, and gives occasion to
the world to adore that perfection, which he is sometimes represented
as doing, when he punishes sin in a visible and exemplary
manner. Thus when God threatens to call for <i>a
sword</i>, and <i>plead against</i> a rebellious people, <i>with pestilence
and with blood</i>, he is said, by this means, to <i>magnify and
sanctify himself</i>, so as to be <i>known</i>, to wit, as an holy God, <i>in
the eyes of many nations</i>. And when he fulfils his promises,
and thereby advances his holiness, as when he brought his people
out of captivity, and gathered them out of the countries,
wherein they had been scattered, he is said to be <i>sanctified in
them</i>, Ezek. xxxviii. 21-23. And he is sanctified by his people,
when they give him the glory that is due to his perfection,
as thus displayed and magnified by him: thus God’s people are
said to <i>sanctify the Lord of hosts</i>, when they make him the object
of their <i>fear and of their dread</i>, Isa. viii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>However, this is not the sense in which we are here to understand
it, but as applied to men; in which respect it is taken
in various senses, namely, for their consecration, or separation
unto God; thus our Saviour says, when devoting and
applying himself to the work, for which he came into the world;
<i>for their sakes I sanctify myself</i>, John xvii. 19. But this is not
the sense in which it is to be understood in this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is often taken, in scripture, for persons being
devoted to God, to minister in holy things: thus Aaron and
his sons were <i>sanctified, that they might minister unto him in
the priest’s office</i>, Exod. xxviii. 41. And it is sometimes taken
for an external federal dedication to God, to walk before him
as a peculiar people in observance of his holy institutions. Thus
when Israel consented to be God’s people they are styled, <i>holiness
unto the Lord</i>, Jer. ii. 3. <i>the holy seed</i>, Ezra ix. 2. and <i>an
holy nation</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 9. And the church, under the gospel-dispensation,
as consecrated, and professing subjection, to
Christ, or separated to his service, and waiting for his presence,
while engaged in all those ordinances, which he has appointed
in the gospel, is described as <i>called to be saints</i>, Rom. i. 7. and
they are hereby related to him, in an external and visible way.
Neither is this the sense in which the word is taken in this answer;
in which we are to understand sanctification as a special
discriminating grace, whereby persons are not barely externally,
but really devoted to Christ by faith: it is the internal
beauty of the soul, whereby all the faculties being renewed,
and a powerful, effectual change wrought therein; they
are enabled to turn from sin unto God, and exercise all those
graces, whereby <i>they walk in holiness and righteousness before
him, all the days of their lives</i>, Luke i. 75. till this work, which
is gradually carried on here, shall be brought to perfection
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It may farther be observed, that sanctification as described
in this answer, may be considered as including in it several
other graces, some of which have been already insisted on,
namely, regeneration, effectual calling, and faith; and there is
another grace connected with it, which will be particularly insisted
on under the next answer, namely, repentance unto life;
all which graces are said to be wrought by the powerful operation
of the Spirit, in those who were, before the foundation of
the world, chosen to be holy. Regeneration is styled, by some,
initial sanctification, as all graces take their first rise from the
principle which is therein implanted. Effectual calling, or conversion,
is that whereby we are brought into the way of holiness,
and internally disposed to walk therein. Faith is that
grace whereby this work is promoted, as all holy actions proceed
from it, as deriving strength from Christ, to perform them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>And repentance is that whereby the work of sanctification discovers
itself, in the soul’s abhorring, and flying from, every
thing that tends to defile it; approves itself to God as one,
who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity without the greatest
detestation. But inasmuch as these graces either have been,
or will be particularly insisted on, in their proper place, we
shall more especially consider sanctification as a progressive
work, whereby it is distinguished from them, by which we
daily consecrate, or devote ourselves to God; and our actions
have all a tendency to advance his glory; and, by the Spirit, we
are enabled more and more to die unto sin, and to live unto
righteousness; so that it is not barely one single act of grace,
but it contains in it the whole progress of the work of grace, as
gradually carried on till perfected in glory: this is what we are
to speak particularly to. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. It includes in it a continual devotedness to God. As the
first act of faith consists in a making a surrender of ourselves
to Christ, depending on his assistance in beginning the work
of obedience in the exercise of all Christian graces; so sanctification
is the continuance thereof. When we are first converted,
we receive Christ Jesus the Lord; and in sanctification
we walk in him, and exercise a daily dependence on him
in the execution of all his offices; make his word our rule, and
delight in it after the inward man. How difficult soever the
duties are that he commands, we take pleasure in the performance
of them, make religion our great business, and in order
thereunto conclude, that every thing we receive from him is
to be improved to his glory. And as every duty is to be performed
by faith; so what has been before observed concerning
the life of faith, is to be considered as an expedient to promote
the work of sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. In the carrying on of this work we are to endeavour, to
our utmost, to fence against the prevailing power of sin, by all
those methods which are prescribed in the gospel, that so it
may not have dominion over us; this is generally styled the
work of mortification. The apostle speaks of <i>our old man being
crucified with Christ, and the body of sin destroyed, that
henceforth we should not serve sin</i>, Rom. vi. 6. and of our crucifying
the flesh with the affections and lusts, and of our <i>mortifying
the deeds of the body through the Spirit</i>, Gal. v. 24. that
is, by his assistance and grace, which is necessary in order
thereunto, Rom. viii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a very difficult work, especially considering the prevalency
of corruption, and the multitude of temptations that
we are exposed to; the subtilty and watchfulness of Satan,
who walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour;
the treachery of our own hearts, that are so prone to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>depart from God; the fickleness and instability of our resolutions;
the irregularity of our affections, and the constant efforts
made by corrupt nature, to gain the ascendant over them, and
turn them aside from God: this it does sometimes by presenting
things in a false view, calling evil good, and good evil;
representing some things as harmless and not displeasing to
God, that are most pernicious and offensive, endeavouring to
lead us into mistakes, as to the matter of sin or duty, and to
persuade us, that those things will issue well which are like to
prove bitterness in the end; and attempting to impose upon us,
as though we were in a right and safe way, when, at the same
time, we are walking contrary to God, and corrupt nature is
gaining strength thereby. But this will be farther considered,
when we speak concerning the imperfection of sanctification in
believers<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. Now this renders it necessary for us to make use
of those methods which God has prescribed for the mortification
of sin; and in order thereunto,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We must endeavour to maintain a constant sense of the
heinous nature of sin, as it is contrary to the holiness of God,
a stain that cannot be washed away, but by the blood of Jesus,
the highest instance of ingratitude for all the benefits which we
have received, a bitter and an only evil, the abominable thing
that God hates; it is not only to be considered as condemning,
but defiling, that hereby we may maintain a constant abhorrence
of it; and that not only of those sins that expose us to
scorn and reproach in the eye of the world, but every thing
that is in itself sinful, as contrary to the law of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We must be watchful against the breakings forth of corrupt
nature, observe the frame and disposition of our spirits,
and the deceitfulness of sin, which has a tendency to harden
us, and avoid all occasions of, or incentives to it, <i>hating even
the garment spotted by the flesh</i>, Jude, ver. 23. <i>abstaining from
all appearance of evil</i>, 2 Thess. v. 22. And to this we may
add, that we are frequently to examine ourselves with respect
to our behaviour in every state of life; whether sin be gaining
or losing ground in us; whether we make conscience of performing
every duty, both personal and relative? what guilt we
contract by sins of omission, or the want of that fervency of
spirit which has a tendency to beget a formal, dead, and stupid
frame and temper of mind, and thereby hinder the progress of
the work of sanctification? but that which is the principal, if
not the only expedient that will prove effectual for the mortifying
of sin is, our seeking help against it from him who is able
to give us the victory over it. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Whatever attempts we use against the prevailing power
of sin, in order to the mortifying of it, these must be performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>by faith; seeking and deriving that help from Christ, which
is necessary in order thereunto. And therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As the dominion of sin consists in its rendering us
guilty in the sight of God, whereby the conscience is burdened,
by reason of the dread that it has of that punishment which
is due to us, and the condemning sentence of the law, which
we are liable to; and as its mortification, in this respect, consists
in our deliverance from that which makes us so uneasy,
no expedient can be used to mortify it, but our looking by faith
to Christ, as a propitiation for sin, whereby we are enabled to
behold the debt which we had contracted, cancelled, the indictment
superseded, and the condemning sentence repealed; from
whence the soul concludes, that iniquity shall not be its ruin.
This is the only method we are to take when oppressed with a
sense of the guilt of sin, which is daily committed by us. It
was shadowed forth by the Israelites looking to the brazen serpent,
a type of Christ crucified, when stung with fiery serpents,
which occasioned exquisite pain, and would, without this expedient,
have brought immediate death: thus the deadly wound
of sin is healed by the sovereign balm of Christ’s blood, applied
by faith; and we, by his having fulfilled the law, may be
said to be dead to it, as freed from the curse thereof, and all
the sad consequences that would ensue thereupon.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As sin is said to have dominion over us, in that all the
powers and faculties of our souls are enslaved by it, whereby,
as the apostle expresses it, <i>we are carnal, sold under sin</i>, Rom.
vii. 14. when we are weak and unable to perform what is good,
and the corruption of nature is so predominant, that we are, as
it were, carried down the stream, which we strive against, but
in vain: in this respect sin is to be mortified, by a fiducial application
to Christ, for help against it; and herein we are to
consider him as having undertaken, not only to deliver from
the condemning, but the prevailing power of sin; which is a
part of the work that he is now engaged in, wherein he applies
the redemption he purchased, by the powerful influences
of the Holy Spirit, and the soul seeks to him for them. As it
is natural for us, when we are in imminent danger of present
ruin, or are assaulted by an enemy, whose superior force we
are not able to withstand, to cry out to some kind friend, for
help; or when we are in danger of death, by some disease
which nature is ready to sink under, to apply ourselves to the
physician for relief: thus the soul is to apply itself to Christ
for strength against the prevailing power of indwelling sin, and
grace to make him more than a conqueror over it; and Christ,
by his Spirit, in this respect, enables us (to use the apostle’s
words,) <i>to mortify the deeds of body</i>, Rom. viii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>And, in order hereunto, we take encouragement, from the
promises of God; and the connexion that there is between
Christ’s having made satisfaction for sin, and his delivering
those who are redeemed, from the power of it, as the apostle
says, <i>Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under
the law</i>, that is, under the condemning sentence of it, <i>but
under grace</i>, chap. vi. 14. as having an interest in that grace
which has engaged to deliver from sin: in both these respects
we consider Christ not only as able, but as having undertaken
to deliver his people from all their spiritual enemies, to relieve
them in all their straits and exigences, and to bring them off
safe and victorious. This is the method which we are to take
to mortify sin; and it is a never-failing remedy. What was
before observed, under the foregoing heads, concerning our
endeavouring to see the evil of sin, and exercising that watchfulness
against the occasions thereof, are necessary duties,
without which sin will gain strength: nevertheless the victory
over it is principally owing to our deriving righteousness and
strength, by faith, from Christ; whereby he has the glory of
a conqueror over it, and we have the advantage of receiving
this privilege as applying ourselves to, and relying on him for
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having considered the way in which sin is to be mortified,
agreeably to the gospel-rule; we shall, before we close this
head, take notice of some other methods which many rest in,
thinking thereby to free themselves from the dominion of sin,
which will not answer that end. Some have no other notion
of sin, but as it discovers itself in those gross enormities which
are matter of public scandal or reproach in the eye of the
world, who do not duly consider the spirituality of the law of
God; such-like sentiments of moral evil, the apostle Paul had,
before his conversion, as he says, <i>I was alive without the law
once</i>, chap. vii. 9. compared with 7. and <i>I had not known lust,
except the law had said, thou shalt not covet</i>. <i>Sin</i> did not <i>appear
to be sin</i>, ver. 13. that is, nothing was thought sin by him,
but that which was openly scandalous, and deemed so by universal
consent; and therefore he says elsewhere, that <i>touching
the righteousness which is in the law, he</i> was <i>blameless</i>, Phil. iii.
6. or, as Ephraim is represented, saying, <i>In all my labour they
shall find none iniquity in me that were sin</i>, Hos. xii. 8. These
persons think they shall come off well, if they can say, that
they are not guilty of some enormous crimes; so that none can
charge them with those open debaucheries, or other sins, that
are not to be mentioned among Christians; or if, through any
change in their condition of life, or being delivered from those
temptations that gave occasion to them; or if there natural
temper be less inclined to them than before, and, as the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>hereof, they abstain from them, this they call a mortifying of
sin; though the most that can be said of it is, that sin is only
curbed, confined, and their natural inclinations to it abated,
while it is far from being dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others, who will allow that sin is of a far larger extent, and
includes in it that which prevails in the heart, as well as renders
itself visible in the life, or contains in it the omission of
duties, as well as the actual commission of known sins; these
often take a preposterous method to mortify it: if they are
sensible of the guilt that is contracted hereby, they use no other
method to be discharged from it, but by pretending to make
atonement, either by confessing their sins, using endeavours to
abstain from them, or by the performance of some duties of
religion, by which they think to make God amends for the injuries
they have offered to him thereby: but this is so far from
mortifying sin, that it increases the guilt thereof, and causes it
to take deeper root, and afterwards to break forth in a greater
degree; or else tends to stupify the conscience, after which
they go on in a way of sin, with carnal security, and without
remorse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others think, that to mortify sin, is nothing else but to subdue
and keep under their passions, at least, to such a degree
that they may not, through the irregularity and impetuous violence
thereof, commit those sins which they cannot but reflect
upon with shame, when brought into a more calm and considerate
temper of mind; and, in order thereunto, they subject
themselves to certain rules, which the light of nature will suggest,
and the wiser Heathen have laid down to induce persons
to lead a virtuous life; and they argue thus with themselves,
that it is below the dignity of the human nature, for men to
suffer their passions to lead their reason captive, or to do that
which betrays a want of wisdom as well as temper; and if by
this means the exorbitancy of their passions is abated, and many
sins, which are occasioned thereby, prevented, they conclude
their lives to be unblemished, and sin subdued; whereas this
is nothing else but restraining the fury of their temper, or giving
a check to some sins, while sin in general remains unmortified.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the methods prescribed by some Popish casuists, of
emaciating, or keeping under the body by physic, or a sparing
diet, and submitting to hard penances, not only to atone for past
sins, but prevent them for the future, these have not a tendency
to strike at the root of sin, and therefore are unjustly called
a mortifying of it. For though an abstemious regular way of
living be conducive to answer some valuable ends, and without
it men are led to the commission of many sins; yet this is no
expedient to take away the guilt thereof; neither is the enslaving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>captivating, and prevailing power of indwelling sin, that
discovers itself in various shapes, and attends every condition
and circumstance of life, sufficiently subdued hereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>And those common methods that many others take, which
are of a different nature, namely, when they resolve, though in
their own strength, to break off their sins by repentance; or,
if their resolutions to lead a virtuous life are weak, and not
much regarded by them, endeavour to strengthen them, this
will not answer their end, sin will be too strong for all their
resolutions, and the engagements with which they bind themselves,
will be like the cords with which Sampson was bound,
which were broken by him like threads. If we rely on our
own strength, how much soever we may be resolved to abstain
from sin at present, God will make us sensible of our
weakness, by leaving us to ourselves; and then, how much
soever we resolve to abstain from sin, it will appear that it
is far from being mortified, or subdued by us. Therefore
we conclude, that this cannot be performed, but by going
forth in the name and strength of Christ, who is able to
keep us from falling; or, when fallen, to recover us; and this
will be found, in the end, to be the best expedient for the promoting
this branch of our sanctification; which leads us to
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. That, in the farther carrying on of this work of sanctification,
we are enabled to walk with God, or before him, in
holiness and righteousness. We are first made alive in regeneration,
and then put forth living actions, which some call vivification,
as distinguished from that part of sanctification, which
has been already considered, namely, mortification of sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is what we may call leading an holy life, whereby we
are to understand much more than many do, who suppose, that
it consists only in the performance of some moral duties, that
contain the external part of religion, without which there would
not be the least shadow of holiness; and in performing those
duties which we owe to men in the various relations which we
stand in to them; or, at least, in keeping ourselves clear from
those <i>pollutions which are in the world through lust</i>, 2 Pet. i. 4.
The Pharisee, in the gospel, thought himself an extraordinary
holy person, because he was no extortioner, nor unjust, nor
adulterer; but fasted, paid tithes, and performed several works
of charity; and many are great pretenders to it, who have no
other than a form of godliness, without the power of it, or who
are more than ordinarily diligent in their attendance on the ordinances
of God’s appointment; though they are far from doing
this in a right way, like those whom the prophet speaks
of, who are said to <i>seek God daily, and to delight to know his
ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>ordinance of their God</i>; though at the same time, they are
said to <i>fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickedness</i>, Isa. lviii. 2. But, that we may consider several
other things, which are contained in a person’s leading an holy
life, let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That our natures must be changed, and therefore sanctification
always supposes and flows from regeneration: there
must be grace in the heart, or else it can never discover itself
in the life; the root must be good, or else the tree cannot bring
forth good fruit; the spring of action must be cleansed, otherwise
the actions themselves will be impure. Some persons,
who are generally strangers to the internal work of grace, are
very apt to insist much on the goodness of their hearts, and
this is sometimes pleaded in excuse for the badness of their
lives; whereas they never had a due sense of the plague and
perverseness of their own hearts. Good actions must proceed
from a good principle, otherwise persons are in an unsanctified
state; and, as they must be conformable to the rule laid down
in the word of God, and performed in a right manner, and to
the glory of God as to the end designed thereby; so they must
be performed by faith, whereby we depend on Christ for assistance
and acceptance, as being sensible of our constant work
and business, whereby we are said to walk with God, as well
as live to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In order to our leading an holy life, we must make use
of those motives and inducements thereunto, that are contained
in the gospel; and to encourage us herein,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are to have in our view that perfect pattern of holiness
which Christ has given us; he has <i>left us an example
that we should follow his steps</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 21. Whatever we find
in the life of Christ, prescribed for our imitation, should be
improved to promote the work of sanctification; his humility,
meekness, patience, submission to the divine will, his zeal for
the glory of God, and the good of mankind, and his unfainting
perseverance in pursuing the end for which he came into the
world, are all mentioned, in scripture, not barely that we should
yield an assent to the account we have thereof in the gospel
history; but that the <i>same mind should be in us, which was also
in him</i>, Phil. ii. 5. or, as the apostle says, <i>He that saith he abideth
in him, ought himself also to walk even as he walked</i>, 1 John
ii. 6. And to this we may add, that we ought to set before us
the example of others, and be followers of them, so far as they
followed him: their example, indeed, is as much inferior to
Christ’s as imperfect holiness is to that which is perfect; but
yet it is an encouragement to us, that in following the footsteps
of the flock, we have many bright examples of those, who
through faith and patience, inherit the promises.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>(2.) Another motive to holiness is the love of Christ, expressed
in the great work of our redemption, and in that care
and compassion which he has extended towards us in the application
thereof, in all the methods he has used in the beginning
and carrying on the work of grace, in which we may say,
hitherto he hath helped us: this ought to be improved so as
to constrain us, 2 Cor. v. 14. as he has hereby laid us under
the highest obligation to live to him. And as love to Christ is
the main ingredient in sanctification; so when by faith we behold
him as the most engaging and desirable object, this will
afford a constant inducement to holiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Another motive hereunto is our relation to God, as his
children, and our professed subjection to him; as we gave up
ourselves to him, when first we believed, avouched him to be
our God, and, since then, have experienced many instances of
his condescending goodness and faithfulness; as he has been
pleased to grant us some degrees of communion with him,
through Christ; and as he has given us many great and precious
promises, and in various instances, made them good to
us; and has reserved an inheritance for all that are sanctified
in that better world, to which they shall be brought at last: this
should induce us to lead a life of holiness, as the apostle says,
<i>Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God</i>,
chap. vii. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said in explaining the doctrine of sanctification,
we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] The difference that there is between moral virtue, so far
as it may be attained by the light of nature, and the improvement
of human reason; and that holiness of heart and life,
which contains in it all Christian virtues, and is inseparably
connected with salvation. All who are conversant in the writings
of some of the Heathen moralists will find a great many
things that tend to regulate the conduct of life; and those precepts
laid down, which, if followed, carry in them a great resemblance
of the grace of sanctification; and herein some, who
have been destitute of the light of the gospel, have very much
excelled many who bear the Christian name: when we find a
lively representation of the universal corruption and degeneracy
of human nature, the disorder and irregularity of the affections,
and man’s natural propensity to vice, rules laid down for
the attaining of virtue, by which means men are directed how
to free themselves from that slavery which they are under
to their lusts, and advice given to press after a resemblance
and conformity to God; this carried in it a great shew of
holiness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>A late writer<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> has collected together several passages out
of their writings, with a design to prove, that though they were
destitute of gospel light, yet they might attain salvation; inasmuch
as they use many expressions that very much resemble
the grace of sanctification: as for instance, when one of them
speaking concerning contentment in the station of life in which
providence had fixed him, says, “A servant of God should not
be solicitous for the morrow. Can any good man fear that
he should want food? Doth God so neglect his servants, and
his witnesses, as that they should be destitute of his care and
providence? And he adds, Did I ever, Lord, accuse thee,
or complain of thy government? Was I not always willing
to be sick when it was thy pleasure that I should be so? Did
I ever, desire to be what thou wouldest not have me to be?
Am I not always ready to do what thou commandest? Wilt
thou have me to continue here, I will freely do as thou willest?
Or, wouldest thou have me depart hence, I will freely
do it at thy command? I have always had my will subject
to that of God; deal with me according to thy pleasure; I
am always of the same mind with thee; I refuse nothing
which thou art pleased to lay upon me; lead me whither
thou wilt; clothe me as thou pleasest; I will be a magistrate
or private person; continue me in my country, or in exile, I
will not only submit to, but defend thy proceedings in all
things.” We might also produce quotations out of other writings
whereby it appears that some of the heathen excelled
many Christians in the consistency of their sentiments about
religious matters, with the divine perfections; as when they
say, Whatever endowment of the mind has a tendency to make
a man truly great and excellent; this is owing to an internal
divine influence.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Others, speaking of the natural propensity
which there is in man to vice, have maintained, that to fence
against it, there is a necessity of their having assistance from
God, in order to their leading a virtuous life; and that virtue
is not attained by instruction, that is, not only by that means,
but that it is from God; and that this is to be sought for at
his hands, by faith and prayer: much to this purpose may be
seen in the writings of Plato, Maximus Tyrius, Hierocles, and
several others.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The principal use that I would make hereof is, to observe
that this should humble many Christians, who are far from
coming up to the Heathen in the practice of moral virtue. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>as for the sentiments of those who deny the necessity of our
having the divine influence in order to our performing the duties
which God requires of us, in a right manner; these fall
very short of what the light of nature has suggested to those
who have duly attended to it, though destitute of divine revelation.
When I meet with such expressions, and many other divine
things, in the writings of Plato; and what he says of the conversation
of his master Socrates, both in his life and death:
I cannot but apply in this case, what our Saviour says to the
scribe in the gospel, who answered him discreetly, <i>Thou art
not far from the kingdom of God</i>, Mark xii. 34. These things,
it is true, very much resemble the grace of sanctification; yet
in many respects, they fall short of it; inasmuch as they had
no acts of faith, in a Mediator, whom they were altogether
strangers to, as being destitute of divine revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not my design, at present, to enquire, whether they had
any hope of salvation? this having been considered under a
foregoing answer<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a>. All that I shall here observe is, that
some of the best of them were charged with notorious crimes,
which a Christian would hardly reckon consistent with the
truth of grace; as Plato, with flattering of tyrants, and too
much indulging pride and luxury<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a>; Socrates, with pleading
for fornication and incest, and practising sodomy, if what some
have reported concerning them be true<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a>. But, without laying
any stress on the character of particular persons, who, in
other respects, have said and done many excellent things; it
is evident, that whatever appearance of holiness there may be
in the writings or conversation of those that are strangers to
Christ and his gospel, this falls short of the grace of sanctification.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>There is a vast difference between recommending or practising
moral virtues, as agreeable to the nature of man, and the
dictates of reason; and a person’s being led in that way of holiness,
which our Saviour has prescribed in the gospel. This
takes its rise from a change of nature, wrought in regeneration,
is excited by gospel-motives, encouraged by the promises thereof,
and proceeds from the grace of faith, without which, all
pretensions to holiness are vain and defective. What advances
soever these may have made in endeavouring to free themselves
from the slavery of sin, they have been very deficient,
as to the mortification thereof; for being ignorant of that great
atonement which is made by Christ, as the only expedient to
take away the guilt of sin, they could not, by any method, arrive
to a conscience void of offence, or any degree of hope
concerning the forgiveness thereof, and the way of acceptance
in the sight of God: and their using endeavours to stop the
current of vice, and to subdue their inordinate affections, could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>not be effectual to answer that end, inasmuch as they were
destitute of the Spirit of God, who affords his divine assistance,
in order thereunto, in no other way than what is prescribed in
the gospel; so that as <i>without holiness no one shall see the Lord</i>,
this grace is to be expected in that way which God has prescribed;
and every one that is holy is made so by the Spirit,
who glorifies himself in rendering men fruitful in every good
work, being raised by him, from the death of sin, to the life of
faith in Christ; which is a blessing peculiar to the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Since holiness is required of all persons, as what is absolutely
necessary to salvation, and is also recommended as that
which God works, in those in whom the gospel is made effectual
thereunto; we may infer, that no gospel-doctrine has the
least tendency to lead to licentiousness. The grace of God
may indeed be abused; and men, who are strangers to it, take
occasion from the abounding thereof, to continue in sin, as
some did in the apostle’s days, Rom. vi. 1. but this is not the
genuine tendency of the gospel, which is to lead men to holiness.
Whatever duties it engages to, they are all designed to
answer this end; and whatever privileges are contained therein,
they are all of them inducements thereunto: are we <i>delivered
out of the hands of our</i> spiritual enemies? it is, <i>that we
should serve him in holiness and righteousness before him, all
the days of our lives</i>, Luke i. 74, 75. As for the promises,
they are an inducement to us, as the apostle expresses it, to
<i>cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God</i>, 2 Cor. vii. 1. and every ordinance
and providence should be improved by us, to promote
the work of sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Let us examine ourselves, whether this work be begun,
and the grace of God wrought in us, in truth? and if so, whether
it be increasing or declining in our souls?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, As to the truth of grace, let us take heed that we do not
think that we are something when we are nothing, deceiving
our own souls, or rest in a form of godliness, while denying
the power thereof, or a name to live, while we are dead; let
us think that it is not enough to abstain from grosser enormities,
or engage in some external duties of religion, with wrong
ends. And if, upon enquiry into ourselves, we find that we
are destitute of a principle of spiritual life and grace, let us
not think, that because we have escaped some of the pollutions
that are in the world, or do not run with others in all excess
of riot, that therefore we lead holy lives; but rather let us enquire,
Whether the life we live in the flesh, be by the faith of
the Son of God, under the influence of his Spirit, with great
diffidence of our own righteousness and strength, and firm dependence
upon Christ? and as the result hereof, whether we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>are found in the practice of universal holiness, and hate and
avoid all appearance of evil, using all those endeavours that
are prescribed in the gospel, to glorify him in our spirits, souls,
and bodies, which are his?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d</i>, If we have ground to hope that the work of sanctification
is begun, let us enquire, whether it be advancing or declining?
Whether we go from strength to strength, or make
improvements in proportion to the privileges we enjoy? Many
have reason to complain that it is not with them as in months
past; that grace is languishing, the frame of their spirits in holy
duties stupid, and they destitute of that communion with God,
which they have once enjoyed; such ought to remember from
whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first works;
and beg of God, from whom alone our fruit is derived, that
he would revive the work, and cause their souls to flourish in
the courts of his house, and to bring forth much fruit unto holiness,
to the glory of his own name, and their spiritual peace
and comfort.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those who are frequently complaining of, and bewailing
their declensions in grace, who seem, to others, to be
making a very considerable progress therein; let them not
give way to unbelief so far as to deny or set aside the experiences
which they have had of God’s presence with them; for
sometimes grace grows, though without our own observation.
If they are destitute of the comforts thereof, or the fruits of
righteousness, which are peace, assurance and joy in the Holy
Ghost, let them consider, that the work of sanctification, in
this present state, is, at best, but growing up towards that perfection
which is not yet arrived to. If it does not spring up
and flourish, as to those fruits and effects thereof, which they
are pressing after, but have not attained; let them bless God,
if grace is taking root downward, and is attended with an
humble sense of their own weakness and imperfection, and an
earnest desire of those spiritual blessings which they are labouring
after. This ought to afford matter of thankfulness, rather
than have a tendency to weaken their hands, or induce
them to conclude that they are in an unsanctified state; because
of the many hindrances and discouragements which attend their
progress in holiness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXVI.</span> <i>What is repentance unto life?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Repentance unto life, is a saving grace, wrought in
the heart of a sinner, by the Spirit and word of God; whereby,
out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but
also of the filth and odiousness of his sins, and upon the apprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of God’s mercy in Christ, to such as are penitent,
he so grieves for, and hates his sins, as that he turns
from them all to God, purposing and endeavouring, constantly
to walk with him in all the ways of new obedience.</p>

<p class='c012'>In speaking to this answer we shall consider the subject of
repentance, <i>viz.</i> a sinful fallen creature; and that, though
this be his condition, yet he is naturally averse to the exercise
thereof, till God is pleased to bring him to it; which will lead
us to consider, how the Spirit of God does this; and what are
the various acts and effects thereof.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c013'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning the subjects of repentance. No one can be
said to repent but a sinner; and therefore, whatever other
graces might be exercised by man in a state of innocency, or
shall be exercised by him, when brought to a state of perfection;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>yet there cannot, properly speaking, be any room for repentance:
some, indeed, have queried whether there shall be
repentance in heaven; but it may easily be determined, that
though that hatred of sin in general, and opposition to it, which
is contained in true repentance, be not inconsistent with a state
of perfect blessedness, as it is inseparably connected with perfection
of holiness; yet a sense of sin, which is afflictive, and
is attended with grief and sorrow of heart, for the guilt and
consequences thereof, is altogether inconsistent with a state of
perfection; and these are some ingredients in that repentance
which comes under our present consideration. Therefore we
must conclude, that the subject of repentance is a sinner: but,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Though all sinners contract guilt, expose themselves to
misery, and will sooner or later be filled with distress and sorrow
for what they have done against God; yet many have no
sense thereof at present, nor repentance, or remorse for it.
These are described as <i>past feeling</i>, Eph. iv. 19. and <i>hardened
through the deceitfulness of sin</i>, Heb. iii. 13. as obstinate, and
having <i>their neck as an iron sinew, and their brow as brass</i>, Isa.
xlviii. 4. And there are several methods which they take to
ward off the force of convictions. Sometimes they are stupid,
and hardly give themselves the liberty to consider the difference
that there is between moral good and evil, or the natural
obligation we are under to pursue the one, and avoid the other.
They consider not the all-seeing eye of God, that observes all
their actions, nor the power of his anger, who will take vengeance
on impenitent sinners; regard not the various aggravations
of sin, nor consider that God will, for those things, bring
them to judgment. So that impenitency is generally attended
with presumption; whereby the person concludes, though without
ground, that it shall go well with him in the end; such an
one is represented, as blessing himself in his heart, saying, <i>I
shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination</i>; or, as it is in
the margin, in the stubbornness <i>of mine heart, to add drunkenness
to thirst</i>, Deut. xxix. 19. Or if, on the other hand, he
cannot but conclude, that with God is terrible majesty, that he
is a consuming fire, and that none ever hardened themselves
against him, and prospered, and if he does not fall down before
him with humble confession of sin, and repentance for it,
he will certainly be broken with his rod of iron, and dashed in
pieces, like the potter’s vessel, broken with a tempest, and utterly
destroyed, when his wrath is kindled; then he resolves,
that some time or other he will repent, but still delays and puts
it off for a more convenient season, and though God gives him
space to do it, repenteth not, Rev. ii. 21. Thus he goes on in
the greatness of his way, till God prevents him with the blessings
of his goodness, and brings him to repentance. And
this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>III. That repentance is God’s work; or, as it is observed in
this answer, wrought by the Spirit of God: whether we consider
it as a common or saving grace, it is the Spirit that convinces
or reproves the world of sin. If it be of the same kind
with that which Pharaoh, Ahab, or Judas had; it is a dread
of God’s judgments, and his wrath breaking in upon conscience,
when he reproves for sin, and sets it in order before their eyes,
that excites it. If they are touched with a sense of guilt, and
hereby, for the present, stopped, or obliged to make a retreat,
and desist from pursuing their former methods, it is God, in
the course of his providence, that gives a check to them. But
this comes short of that repentance which is said to be unto
life; or which is styled a saving grace, which is wrought by
the Spirit of God, as the beginning of that saving work, which
is a branch of sanctification, and shall end in compleat salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is expressly styled in scripture, <i>repentance unto life</i>,
Acts xi. 18. inasmuch as every one, who is favoured with it,
shall obtain eternal life; and it is connected with conversion
and remission of sins, which will certainly end in eternal salvation.
Thus it is said, <i>Repent and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
presence of the Lord</i>, chap. iii. 9. and for this reason it is
called a saving grace, or a grace that accompanies salvation,
whereby it is distinguished from that repentance which some
have, who yet remain in a state of unregeneracy. And it is
called, <i>Repentance to salvation, not to be repented of</i>, 2 Cor. vii.
10. that is, it shall issue well; and he shall, in the end, have
reason to bless God, and rejoice in his grace, that has made
him partaker of it, who thus repents.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall now consider the instrument or means whereby
the Spirit works this grace.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Thus it is said to be wrought
in the heart of a sinner, by the word of God, as all other
graces are, except regeneration, as has been before observed:
we must first suppose the principle of grace implanted, and the
word presenting motives, and arguments leading to repentance;
and then the understanding is enlightened and disposed
to receive what is therein imparted. The word <i>calls sinners to
repentance</i>, Matt. ix. 13. and therefore, when this grace is
wrought, we are not only turned by the power of God, but <i>instructed</i>,
Jer. xxxi. 19. by the Spirit’s setting home what is
contained therein whereby we are led into the knowledge of
those things which are necessary to repentance. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We have in the word a display of the holiness of the divine
nature and law, and our obligation in conformity thereunto,
to the exercise of holiness in heart and life, as God says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span><i>Be ye holy, for I am holy</i>, Lev. xi. 44. And to this we may
add, that it contains a display of the holiness of God in his
threatenings, which he has denounced against every transgression
and disobedience, which shall receive a just recompence
of reward; and in all the instances of his punishing sin in
those who have exposed themselves thereunto, that hereby he
might deter men from it, and lead them to repentance: thus
the apostle speaks of <i>the law</i> of God as <i>holy, and the commandment
holy, just, and good</i>, Rom. vii. 12, 13. and of its leading
him into the knowledge of sin, by which means it appeared to
be sin, that is, opposite to an holy God, and, as he expresses
it, <i>became exceeding sinful</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Hereby persons are led into themselves; and by comparing
their hearts and lives with the word of God, are enabled
to see their own vileness and want of conformity to the rule
which he has given them, the deceitfulness and desperate
wickedness thereof, and what occasion there is to abhor themselves,
and repent in dust and ashes; thus the apostle, in the
place but now mentioned, speaks of himself as <i>once alive without
the law; but when the commandment came, sin revived and
he died</i>, and concludes himself to be <i>carnal, sold under sin</i>, Rom.
vii. 9, 14. This is a necessary means leading to repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we may farther add, that God not only makes use of
the word, but of his providences to answer this end; therefore
he speaks of a sinning people, <i>when carried away captive into
the land of the enemy</i>, as <i>bethinking</i> themselves, and afterwards
<i>repenting and making supplication to him</i> therein, 1 Kings viii.
46, 47. And we read of sickness and bodily diseases as ordained
by God, to bring persons to repentance; thus Elihu
speaks of a person’s being <i>chastened with pain upon his bed,
and the multitude of his bones with strong pain; his soul drawing
nigh to the grave, and his life to the destroyers</i>, Job xxxiii.
19, 27. and then represents the person thus chastened, and afterwards
recovered from his sickness, as acknowledging himself
to <i>have sinned, and perverted that which is right, and</i> that
<i>it profited him not</i>. And the apostle speaks of <i>the goodness of
God</i> in the various dispensations of his providence, as <i>leading to
repentance</i>, Rom. ii. 4. But these dispensations are always to
be considered in conjunction with the word, and as impressed
on the conscience of men by the Spirit, in order to their attaining
this desirable end.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that we may insist on this matter more particularly, we
must take an estimate of repentance, either as it is a common
or special grace; in both these respects it is from the Spirit,
and wrought by the instrumentality of the word, applied to the
consciences of men; but there is a vast difference between the
one and the other in the application of the word, as well as in
the effects and consequences thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>(1.) In them who are brought under convictions, but not
made partakers of the saving grace of repentance; the Holy
Spirit awakens, and fills them with the terrors of God, and the
dread of his vengeance, <i>by the law</i>, by which <i>is the knowledge
of sin</i>, and <i>all the world becomes guilty before God</i>, Rom. iii.
20. compared with 19. These are what we call legal convictions;
whereby the wound is opened, but no healing medicine
applied: the sinner apprehends himself under a sentence of
condemnation, but at the same time cannot apply any promise
which may afford hope and relief to him; groans under his
burden, and knows not where to find ease or comfort, and
dreads the consequence thereof, as that which would sink him
into hell; God appears to him as a consuming fire, his arrows
stick fast in his soul, the poison whereof drinketh up his spirits;
if he endeavours to shake off his fears, and to relieve
himself against his despairing thoughts, he is notwithstanding,
described, as being like the <i>troubled sea</i>, when it <i>cannot rest</i>,
which <i>casts forth mire and dirt</i>, Isa. lvii. 20. This is a most afflictive
case; concerning which it is said, that though <i>the spirit
of a man will sustain his infirmity</i>; <i>yet a wounded spirit who
can bear</i>? Prov. xviii. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it is with some when convinced of sin by the law: but
there are others who endeavour to quiet their consciences by
using indirect methods, thinking to make atonement for it, and
by some instances of external reformation, to make God
amends, and thereby procure his favour, but to no purpose;
for <i>sin taking occasion, by the commandment, works in them all
manner of concupiscence</i>, Rom. vii. 8. And if they grow stupid,
which is oftentimes the consequence hereof, their sense of
sin is entirely lost, and their repentance ends in presumption,
and a great degree of boldness in the commission of all manner
of wickedness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We shall now consider how the Spirit works repentance
unto life, which is principally insisted on in this answer.
This is said to be done by the word of God; not by the law
without the gospel, but by them both, in which one is made
subservient to the other. The law shews the soul its sin, and
the gospel directs him where he may find a remedy; one
wounds and the other heals; <i>the law enters</i>, as the apostle expresses
it, <i>that the offence might abound</i>, Rom. v. 20. but the
gospel shews him how <i>grace</i> does <i>much more abound</i>, and where
he may obtain forgiveness, by which means he is kept from
sinking under that weight of guilt that lies on his conscience.
And it leads him to hate and abstain from sin, from those motives
that are truly excellent; for which reason it is called
evangelical repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we may better understand the nature thereof, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>shall consider; how it differs from that which we before described,
which arises only from that conviction of sin, which
is by the law, which a person may have, who is destitute of
this grace of repentance, which we are speaking of. Repentance,
of what kind soever it be, contains in it a sense of sin:
but if it be such a sense of sin, that the unregenerate person
may have, this includes little more in it than a sense of the
danger and misery which he has exposed himself to by sins
committed. The principal motives leading hereunto, are the
threatenings which the law of God denounces against those that
violate it. Destruction from God is a terror to him; if this
were not the consequence of sin, he would be so far from repenting
of it, that it would be the object of his chief delight.
And that guilt, which he charges himself with, is principally
such, as arises from the commission of the most notorious
crimes, which expose him to the greatest degree of punishment:
whereas, repentance unto life brings a soul under a sense
of the guilt of sin, as it is contrary to the holy nature and law
of God, which the least, as well as the greatest sins, are opposed
to, and contain a violation of. And therefore he charges
himself, not only with open sins, which are detestable in the
eyes of men; but secret sins, which others have little or no
sense of; sins of omission, as well as sins of commission; and
he is particularly affected with the sin of unbelief, inasmuch as
it contains a contempt of Christ, and the grace of the gospel.
And he is not only sensible of those sins which break forth in
his life; but that propensity of nature, whereby he is inclined
to rebel against God; so that this sense of guilt, in some respects,
differs from that which they are brought under, who
are destitute of saving repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that in which they more especially differ is, in that saving
repentance contains in it a sense of the filth, and odious
nature of sin, and so considers it as defiling, or contrary to the
holiness of God, and rendering the soul worthy to be abhorred
by him; so that as the sense of guilt excites fear, and a dread
of the wrath of God, this fills him with shame, confusion of
face, and self-abhorrence, which is inseparably connected with
the grace of repentance; accordingly these are joined together,
as Job says, <i>I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes</i>, Job
xlii. 6. or, as when God promises that he would bestow this
grace on his people, he says, <i>Then shall ye remember your own
evil ways, and your doings, that were not good, and shall loathe
yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities, and for your
abominations</i>, Ezek. xxxvi. 31. As before this they set too
high a value upon themselves, and were ready to palliate and
excuse their crimes, or insist on their innocence, though their
iniquity was written in legible characters, as with a pen of iron,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and the point of a diamond, and to say with Ephraim, <i>In all
my labour they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin</i>,
Hos. xii. 8. or, as the prophet Jeremiah says, concerning a rebellious
people, that <i>though in their skirts were found the blood
of the souls of the poor innocents</i>; yet they had the front to say,
<i>Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me</i>, Jer.
ii. 34, 35. Notwithstanding, when God brings them to repentance,
and heals their backslidings; they express themselves in
a very different way; <i>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion
covers us; for we have sinned against the Lord our God</i>,
chap. iii. 25. Now this is such an ingredient in true repentance,
which is not to be found in that which falls short of it:
the sinner is afraid of punishment indeed, or, it may be, he may
be filled with shame, because of the reproach which attends his
vile and notorious crimes in the eyes of the world; yet he is
not ashamed, or confounded, as considering how vile he has
rendered himself hereby, in the eye of an holy God.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another thing which is farther observed in this answer,
which is an ingredient in repentance unto life, in which
respect it is connected with faith, inasmuch as he apprehends
the mercy of God in Christ to such as are penitent; and this
effectually secures him from that despair which sometimes attends
a legal repentance, as was before observed, as well as
affords him relief against the sense of guilt with which this
grace is attended. The difference between legal and evangelical
repentance, does not so much consist in that one represents sin,
as more aggravated; nor does it induce him that thus repents,
to think himself a greater sinner than the other; for the true
penitent is ready to confess himself the chief of sinners. He
is far from extenuating his sin, being ready, on all occasions,
to charge himself with more guilt than others are generally
sensible of: but that which he depends upon as his only comfort
and support is the mercy of God in Christ, or the consideration
that there is forgiveness with him, that he may be
feared; this is that which affords the principal motive and encouragement
to repentance, and has a tendency to excite the
various acts thereof; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. What are the various acts of this repentance unto life;
or what are the fruits and effects produced thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The soul is filled with hatred of sin. When he looks back
on his past life, he bewails what cannot now be avoided;
charges himself with folly and madness, and wishes (though
this be to no purpose) that he had done many things which he
has omitted, and avoided those sins, together with the occasions
thereof, which he has committed, the guilt whereof lies
with great weight upon him. How glad would he be if lost
seasons and opportunities of grace might be recalled, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>talents, that were once put into his hand, though misimproved,
regained! But all these wishes are in vain. However, these
are the after-thoughts which will arise in the minds of those
who are brought under a sense of sin. Sin wounds the soul;
the Spirit of God, when convincing thereof, opens the wound,
and causes a person to feel the smart of it, and gives him to
know, that <i>it is an evil thing, and bitter, that he has forsaken the
Lord his God</i>, Jer. ii. 19. This sometimes depresses the spirits,
and causes him to walk softly, to <i>set alone and keep silence</i>,
Lam. iii. 28. being filled with that uneasiness which is very
afflictive to him. At other times it gives vent to itself in tears,
as the Psalmist expresses it, <i>I am weary with my groaning,
all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with
my tears</i>, Psal. vi. 6. In this case the only thing that gives
him relief or comfort is, that the guilt of sin is removed by
the blood of Christ, which tends to quiet his spirit, which would
otherwise be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that sin is always the object of his
detestation, even when there is an abatement of that grief,
which, by the divine supports and comforts he is fenced against:
he hates sin, not barely because of the sad consequences
thereof, but as it is in itself the object of abhorrence; and
therefore his heart is set against all sin, as the Psalmist says,
<i>I hate every false way</i>, Psal. cxix. 104. This hatred discovers
itself by putting him upon flying from it, together with all the
occasions thereof, or incentives to it. He not only abstains from
those sins which they who have little more than the remains of
moral virtue are ashamed of, and afraid to commit, but hates
every thing that has in it the appearance of sin, and this hatred
is irreconcileable. As forgiveness does not make sin less odious
in its own nature, so the experience that he has of the grace of
God herein, or whatever measures of peace he enjoys, whereby
his grief and sorrow is assuaged, yet still his hatred of it not
only remains, but increases: and, as the consequence hereof,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He turns from sin unto God; he first hates sin, and then
flies from it, as seeing it to be the spring of all his grief and
fears, that which separates between him and his God. Thus
Ephraim, when brought to repentance, is represented as saying,
<i>What have I to do any more with idols</i>, Hos. xiv. 8. reflecting
on his past conduct, when addicted to them, with a
kind of indignation; so the true penitent, who has hitherto
been walking in those paths that lead to death and destruction,
now enquires after the way of holiness, and the paths of peace;
as he has hitherto walked contrary to God, now he desires to
walk with him; and having wearied himself in the greatness of
his way, and seeing no fruit in those things whereof he is now
ashamed; and being brought into the utmost straits, he determines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to return to his God and Father. And in doing this he
purposes and endeavours to walk with him in all the ways of
new obedience, as the apostle exhorts those who had received
good by his ministry, that <i>with purpose of heart they would
cleave unto the Lord</i>, Acts xi. 23. This purpose is not like those
hasty resolutions which unconverted sinners make when God
is hedging up their way with thorns, and they are under the
most distressing apprehensions of his wrath. Then they say as
the people did to Joshua, <i>We will serve the Lord</i>, Josh. xxiv.
22. though they are not sensible how difficult it is to fulfil the
engagements which they lay themselves under, nor of the deceitfulness
of their own hearts, and the need they stand in of
grace from God, to enable them so to do. This purpose to
walk with God, does not so much respect what a person will
do hereafter; but it contains a resolution which is immediately
put in execution, and so is opposed to his former obstinacy,
when determining to go on in the way of his own heart. Thus
the prodigal son, in the parable, no sooner resolved that he
would <i>arise and go to his Father</i>, Luke xv. 18, compared with
20. but he arose and went. True repentance is always attended
with endeavours after new obedience, so that a person lays
aside that sloth and indolence which was inconsistent with his
setting a due value on, or improving the means of grace; and,
as the result hereof, he now exerts himself, with all his might,
in pursuing after those things, whereby he may approve himself
God’s faithful servant; and hereby he discovers the sincerity
of his repentance; which he does, or rather is enabled to
do, by that grace, which at first began, and then carries on this
work in the soul, whereby he <i>has his fruit unto holiness, and
the end</i> thereof <i>everlasting life</i>, Rom. vi. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning repentance, we may
infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That since it is a grace that accompanies salvation, and
consequently is absolutely necessary thereunto, it is an instance
of unwarrantable and bold presumption, for impenitent sinners
to expect, that they shall be made partakers of the benefits
which Christ has purchased, while they continue in a state of
enmity, opposition, and rebellion against him; or that they shall
be saved by him in their sins, without being saved from them;
for <i>he that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth
and forsaketh them, shall have mercy</i>, Prov. xxviii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Since repentance is the work of the Spirit, and his gift,
we infer, that whatever endeavours we are obliged to use, or
whatever motives or inducements are given to lead us hereunto,
we must not conclude, that it is in our own power to repent
when we please; and therefore it should be the matter of our
earnest and constant prayer to God, that he would turn our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>hearts, give us a true sight and sense of sin, accompanied with
faith in Christ, as Ephraim is represented, saying, <i>Turn thou
me, and I shall be turned</i>, Jer. xxxi. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Let not those that have a distressing sense of their former
sins, how great soever they have been, give way to despairing
thoughts; but lay hold on the mercy of God in Christ, extended
to the chief of sinners, and improve it to encourage them
to hate sin, and forsake it from evangelical motives, which will
have a tendency to remove their fears while they look on God,
not as a sin-revenging Judge, but a reconciled Father, ready
and willing to receive those who return to him with unfeigned
repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Since we daily commit sin, it follows from hence, that
we stand in need of daily repentance: and this being a branch
of sanctification, as sanctification is a progressive work, so is repentance.
We are not to expect that sin should be wholly extirpated,
while we are in this imperfect state; and therefore it
is constantly to be bewailed, and, by the grace of God working
effectually in us, avoided; that, as the result hereof, we may
have a comfortable hope that that promise shall be fulfilled,
<i>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy</i>, Psal. cxxvi. 5.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXVII.</span> <i>Wherein do justification and sanctification
differ?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification;
yet they differ, in that God in justification, imputeth
the righteousness of Christ, in sanctification his Spirit
infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof; in the
former sin is pardoned, in the other it is subdued; the one
doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of
God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into
condemnation, the other is neither equal in all, nor in this
life perfect in any, but growing up to perfection.</p>

<p class='c012'>This answer being principally a recapitulation of what is
contained in those that have been already insisted on,
wherein the doctrine of justification and sanctification are particularly
explained, we shall not much enlarge on it; but since
there are some who suppose that one of these graces may be attained
without the other; and others confound them, as though
to be justified and to be sanctified implied the same thing; we
shall briefly consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That which is supposed in this answer, namely, that sanctification
and justification are inseparably joined together; and
accordingly, no one has a warrant to claim one without the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>other: This appears in that they are graces that accompany salvation.
When the apostle connects justification and effectual
calling together, in the golden chain of our salvation, Rom.
viii. 30. he includes sanctification in this calling. And elsewhere,
when Christ is said to be <i>made righteousness and redemption</i>
to us for our justification, he is, at the same time, said to
be made <i>wisdom and sanctification</i>, 1 Cor. i. 31. and we are
said to be <i>saved by the washing of regeneration and renewing
of the Holy Ghost</i>, Tit. iii. 5. which is the beginning of the
work of sanctification; <i>that being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life</i>; and
speaking of some who were once great sinners, and afterwards
made true believers, he says, concerning them, that they were
<i>washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and by the Spirit of our God</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 11. And when God
promises to pardon and <i>pass by the transgression of the remnant
of his heritage</i>, Micah vii. 18, 19. he also gives them ground
to expect that he would <i>subdue their iniquities</i>; the former is
done in justification, the latter in sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the connexion that there is between justification and
sanctification, we infer: that no one has ground to conclude
that his sins are pardoned, and that he shall be saved while he
is in an unsanctified state; for as this tends to turn the grace of
God into wantonness, so it separates what he has joined together,
and it is a certain evidence that they who thus divide
them, are neither justified nor sanctified. Let us therefore give
diligence to evince the truth of our justification, by our sanctification,
or that we have a right and title to Christ’s righteousness,
by the life of faith, and the exercise of all those other graces
that accompany or flow from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We have, in this answer, an account of some things in
which justification and sanctification differ, as,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In justification God imputes the righteousness of Christ
to us; whereas, in sanctification the Spirit infuseth grace, and
enableth to the exercise thereof. What it is for God to impute
Christ’s righteousness hath been before considered; the only
thing that we shall now observe is, that the righteousness whereby
we are justified, is, without us, wrought out by Christ, for
us; so that it is <i>by his obedience</i>, as the apostle expresses it,
that <i>we are made righteous</i>, Rom. v. 19. and that which Christ
did as our Surety, is placed to our account, and accepted by
the justice of God, as though it had been done by us, as has
been before observed: Whereas, in sanctification, the graces
of the Spirit are wrought and excited in us, we are denominated
holy, and our right to eternal life is evinced, though not
procured.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In justification sin is pardoned, in sanctification it is subdued;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the former takes away the guilt thereof, the latter its
reigning power. Where sin is pardoned, it shall not be our
ruin; but yet it gives us daily disturbance and uneasiness, makes
work for repentance, and is to be opposed by our dying to it,
and living to righteousness. This is therefore sufficiently distinguished
from justification, which is also to be considered as
a motive or inducement leading to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They differ, in that justification equally frees all believers
from the avenging wrath of God, in which respect it is perfect
in this life, so that a justified person shall never fall into condemnation;
whereas, the work of sanctification is not equal
in all, nor perfect in this life, but growing up to perfection.
For the understanding of which, let us consider, that when we
speak of justification as perfect in this life, or say, that all are
equally justified, we mean, that where God forgives one sin,
he forgives all; so that <i>there is no condemnation to them which
are in Christ Jesus</i>, as the apostle says, chap. viii. 1. and he
adds, <i>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? it
is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? it is Christ
that died</i>, ver. 33, 34. Were it not so, a person might be said
to be justified, and not have a right to eternal life, which implies
a contradiction; for though he might be acquitted, as to the
guilt charged upon him by one indictment, he would be condemned
by that which is contained in another.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may from hence infer, that all justified persons have an
equal right to conclude themselves discharged from guilt, and
the condemning sentence of the law of God; though all cannot
see their right to claim this privilege by reason of the weakness
of their faith. As for sanctification, that, on the other hand,
is far from being equal in all; since the best of believers have
reason to complain of the weakness of their faith, and the imperfection
of all other graces which are wrought in them by the
Spirit. If it be enquired from whence this imperfection of
sanctification arises, that is the subject of the following answer.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-78' class='c003'>Quest. LXXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXXVIII. <i>Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification
in believers?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The imperfection of sanctification in believers, ariseth
from the remains of sin abiding in every part of them, and
the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit, whereby
they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many
sins, are hindered in all their spiritual services, and their
best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this answer we may consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That there is something supposed, namely, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>work of sanctification is imperfect in this life, or that there are
the remnants of sin still abiding in the best of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. In what the imperfection of sanctification more especially
discovers itself; and in particular, what we are to understand
by the lusting of the flesh against the Spirit. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The consequences hereof, to wit, their being foiled
with temptations, falling into many sins, and being hindered in
their spiritual services.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the thing supposed in this answer, that the work
of sanctification is imperfect in this life: This must be allowed
by all who are not strangers to themselves, as it is said,
<i>There is not a just man upon the earth that doth good and sinneth
not</i>, Eccl. vii. 20. fine gold is not without a mixture of
some baser metal, or alloy; even so our best frames of spirit,
when we think ourselves nearest heaven, or when we have most
communion with God, are not without a tincture of indwelling
sin, that is easy to be discerned in us. Whatever grace we exercise,
there are some defects attending it, either with respect
to the manner of its exerting itself, or the degree thereof;
therefore perfection, how desirable soever it be, is a blessing
which we cannot, at present, attain to: And if it be thus with
us, when at the best, we shall find, that at other times, corrupt
nature not only discovers itself, but gives us great interruption
and disturbance, so that the work of sanctification seems to be,
as it were, at a stand, and we are hereby induced to question
the truth and sincerity of our graces; and if, notwithstanding
this, we have sufficient ground to conclude, that our hearts are
right with God; yet we are obliged to say with the apostle, that
we are <i>carnal, sold under sin</i>; and that, <i>when we would do good,
evil is present with us</i>, Rom. vii. 14. compared with 21. which
is an undeniable argument of the imperfection of the work of
sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contrary opinion to this is maintained by many who pretend
that perfection is attainable in this life; and to give countenance
hereunto, they refer to some scriptures, in which persons
are characterized as <i>perfect</i> men; and others wherein perfection
is represented as a duty incumbent on us; as our Saviour
says, <i>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect</i>, Matt. v. 48. and the apostle, in his valedictory
exhortation to the church, advises them to <i>be perfect</i>, as well
as <i>of one mind</i>; as they expected that the God of love and
peace should be with them, 2 Cor. xiii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied, that these scriptures do not
speak of a sinless perfection, but of such a perfection as is opposed
to hypocrisy; as Hezekiah says concerning himself, that
he had <i>walked before the Lord in truth, and with a perfect heart</i>,
Isa. xxxviii. 3. Accordingly, the perfection of those who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>thus described in scripture, is explained as denoting their uprightness.
Thus Job is described, as <i>a perfect and upright
man, one that feared God and eschewed evil</i>, Job i. 1. compared
with 8. though he elsewhere disclaims any pretensions to a
sinless perfection; as he expresses himself, <i>If I say I am perfect,
mine own mouth shall prove me perverse</i>, chap. ix. 20.
And when Noah is said to be <i>perfect in his generation</i>, this is
explained as denoting that he was a <i>just</i> or an <i>holy man</i>, and
one that <i>walked with God</i>, Gen. vi. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for other scriptures, which speak of perfection as a duty
incumbent on us, they are to be understood concerning the perfection
of grace, as to those essential parts thereof, without
which it could not be denominated true and genuine, and not
as respecting a perfection of degrees. True grace is perfect
indeed, as it contains in it those necessary ingredients, whereby
an action is denominated good in all its circumstances, in
opposition to that which is so, only in some respects; and
therefore it must proceed from a good principle, an heart renewed
by regenerating grace; it must be agreeable to the rule
which God has prescribed in the gospel, and be performed in
a right manner, and for right ends: Thus a person may be
said to be a perfect man, in like manner as a new-born infant
is denominated a man, as having all the essential perfections
of the human nature; though not arrived to that perfection, in
other respects, which it shall afterwards attain to: Accordingly
grace, when described, in scripture, as perfect, is sometimes
explained as alluding to a metaphor, taken from a state of perfect
manhood, in opposition to that of children: Thus the apostle
speaks of some, whom he represents, <i>as being of full age</i>;
where the same word is used<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c013'><sup>[223]</sup></a>, which is elsewhere rendered
<i>perfect</i>; and these are opposed to others whom he had before
been speaking of, as weak believers, or <i>babes</i> in Christ; Heb.,
v. 13, 14. And elsewhere he speaks of the church, which he
styles the <i>body of Christ</i>, as arrived to a state of manhood, and
so calls it a perfect man; having attained <i>the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ</i>; still alluding to that stature
which persons arrive to when they are adult; and these he opposes
in the following words, to children, who, through the
weakness of their faith, were liable to be <i>tossed to and fro, and
carried about with every wind of doctrine</i>, Eph. iv. 13, 14.
And in other places, where Christians are described as perfect,
there is a word used, which signifies their having that internal
furniture whereby they are prepared or disposed to do what is
good: Thus the apostle speaks of <i>the man of God</i> being <i>perfect</i><a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a>,
that is, <i>throughly furnished unto all good works</i>, 2 Tim. iii. 17.
And elsewhere he prays, for those to whom he writes, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>God would <i>make them perfect in</i>, or for <i>every good work</i>, to
the end <i>that they may do his will</i><a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a>, which is such a perfection
as is necessary to our putting forth any act of grace; and therefore
it does not in the least infer that perfection which they
plead for, whom we are now opposing.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, indeed, it is not barely the sense they give of those
scriptures that speak of persons being perfect, which they cannot
but suppose may be otherwise understood, that gives them
occasion to defend this doctrine; but the main thing on which
it is founded, is, that God does not require sinless perfection
of fallen man, inasmuch as that is impossible; and therefore
he calls that perfection, which includes in it our using those
endeavours to lead a good life, which are in our own power.
This is agreeable to the Pelagian scheme, and to that which
the Papists maintain, who make farther advances on the Pelagian
hypothesis; and assert, not only that men may attain perfection
in this life, but that they may arrive to such a degree
thereof, as exceeds the demands of the law, and perform works
of supererogation; which doctrine is calculated to establish
that of justification by works.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which may be alleged in opposition hereunto, is,
that it is disagreeable to the divine perfections, and a notorious
making void the law of God, to assert that our obligation
to yield perfect obedience, ceases, because we have lost our
power to perform it; as though a person’s being insolvent,
were a sufficient excuse for his not paying a just debt. We
must distinguish between God’s demanding perfect obedience,
as an out-standing debt, which is consistent with the glory of
his holiness and sovereignty, as a law-giver; and his determining
that we shall not be saved, unless we perform it in our
own persons: and we also distinguish between his connecting
a right to eternal life with our performing perfect obedience, as
what he might justly insist on according to the tenor of the
first covenant, as our Saviour tells the young man in the gospel,
<i>If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments</i>, Matt.
xix. 16. and his resolving that we shall not be saved, unless
we are able to perform it. The gospel purposes another expedient,
namely, that they who were obliged to yield perfect
obedience, and ought to be humbled for their inability to perform
it, should depend on Christ’s righteousness, which is the
foundation of their right to eternal life, in which respect they
are said to be perfect, or <i>compleat in him</i>, Col. ii. 10. which is
the only just notion of perfection, as attainable in this life: and,
to conclude this head, it is very unreasonable for a person to
suppose that God will abate some part of the debt of perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>obedience, and so to call our performing those works, which
have many imperfections adhering to them, a state of perfection,
which is to make it an easier matter to be a Christian
than God has made it. Thus concerning the thing supposed
in this answer, <i>viz.</i> that the work of sanctification is imperfect
in this life.</p>

<p class='c006'>But before we dismiss this head, we shall enquire, why God
does not bring this work to perfection at once, which he could
easily have done, and, as it is certain, will do, when he brings
the soul to heaven. In answer to which, we shall consider in
general, that it is not meet for us to say unto God, Why dost
thou thus? especially considering that this, as well as many of
his other works, is designed to display the glory of his sovereignty,
which very eminently appears in the beginning, carrying
on, and perfecting the work of grace: we may as well ask
the reason, why he did not begin the work of sanctification
sooner? or, why he makes use of this or that instrument, or
means, to effect it rather than another? which things are to be
resolved into his own pleasure: but since it is evident that he
does not bring this work to perfection in this world, we may
adore his wisdom herein, as well as his sovereignty. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Hereby he gives his people occasion to exercise repentance
and godly sorrow for their former sins committed before
they were converted. Perfect holiness would admit of no occasion
to bring past sins to remembrance; whereas, when we
sin daily, and have daily need of the exercise of repentance
and godly sorrow, this gives us a more sensible view of past
sins. When corrupt nature discovers itself in those that are
converted, they take occasion hereby to consider how they have
been transgressors from the womb; as David, when he repented
of his sin in the matter of Uriah, at the same time that he
aggravated the guilt of his crime, as it justly deserved, he calls
to mind his former sins, from his very infancy, and charges
that guilt upon himself which he brought into the world; <i>Behold
I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me</i>, Psal. li. 5. And when Job considers God’s afflictive providences
towards him, as designed to bring sin to remembrance,
and desires that he would <i>make him to know his transgression
and his sin</i>; he adds, <i>Thou writest bitter things against
me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth</i>,
Job. xiii. 23, 26. sins committed after conversion were brought
to mind, and ordered as a means to humble him for those that
were committed before it. As for sins committed before conversion,
they could not, at that time, be said truly to be repented
of, since that would be to suppose the grace of repentance
antecedent to conversion; therefore if the work of sanctification
were to be immediately brought to perfection, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>perfect holiness would be as much attended with perfect happiness,
as it is in heaven, and consequently godly sorrow would
be no more exercised on earth, than it is there; whereas God,
in ordering the gradual progress of the work of sanctification,
attended with the remainders of sin, gives occasion to many
humbling reflections, tending to excite unfeigned repentance,
not only for those sins committed after they had experienced
the grace of God; but for those great lengths they ran in sin
before they had tasted that the Lord was gracious; and therefore
he does not bring the work of sanctification to perfection
in this present world.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another reason of this dispensation of providence, is, that
believers, from their own experience of the breakings forth of
corruption, together with the guilt they contract thereby, and
the advantage they receive in gaining any victory over it, may
be furnished to administer suitable advice, and give warning
to those who are in a state of unregeneracy, that they may be
persuaded to see the evil of sin, which, at present, they do not.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. God farther orders this, that he may give occasion to his
people to exercise a daily conflict with indwelling sin. He
suffers it to give them great disturbance and uneasiness, that
hereby they may be induced to endeavour to mortify it, and be
found in the exercise of those graces which are adapted to an
imperfect state, such as cannot be exercised in heaven; nor
could they be exercised here on earth, were they to be brought
into and remain while here in a sinless state; particularly
there could not be any acts of faith, in managing that conflict,
whereby they endeavour to stand their ground while exposed
to those difficulties that arise from the perpetual lustings of the
flesh against the spirit; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. In what the imperfection of sanctification more especially
discovers itself. This it does, not only in the weakness of
every grace, which we are at any time enabled to act; and the
many failures we are chargeable with in the performance of
every duty incumbent upon us; so that if an exact scrutiny
were made into our best actions, and they weighed in the balance,
they would be found very defective; as appears from
what has been said under the foregoing head, concerning perfection,
as not attainable in this life.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this more particularly appears, as it is observed in this
answer, from the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the
spirit. Thus the apostle speaks of, <i>the flesh lusting against
the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh</i>, Gal. v. 19. and so of
the contrariety of the one to the other; <i>so that we cannot do
the things that we would</i>, and points out himself as an instance
hereof, when he says, <i>I know that in me, that is, in my
flesh, dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>how to perform that which is good, I find not; the good that I
would I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do</i>, Rom.
vii. 18-23. and this reluctancy and opposition to what is good,
he lays to the charge of sin that dwelt in him, which he considers
as having, as it were, the force of a law; and in particular
he styles it <i>the law of his members warring against the
law of his mind</i>, which is the same thing with the lusting of
the flesh, against the spirit: so that from hence it appears, that
when God implants a principle of grace in regeneration, and
carries on the work of sanctification in believers, he does not
wholly destroy, or root out those habits of sin which were in
the soul before this, but enables us to militate against, and
overcome them by his implanting and exciting a principle of
grace; and from hence arises this conflict that we are to consider.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indwelling sin is constantly opposing; but it does not always
prevail against the principle of grace. The event or success
of this combat is various, at different times. When corrupt
nature prevails, the principle of grace, though not wholly extinguished,
remains unactive, or does not exert itself, as at other
times; all grace becomes languid, and there appears but
little difference between him and an unbeliever; he falls into
very great sins, whereby he wounds his own conscience,
grieves the holy Spirit, and makes sad work for a bitter repentance,
which will afterwards ensue: but inasmuch as the principle
of spiritual life and grace is not wholly lost, it will some
time or other be excited, and then will oppose, and maintain
its ground against, the flesh, or the corruption of nature; and,
as the consequence hereof, those acts of grace will be again put
forth, which were before suspended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having thus given an account of the conflict between indwelling
sin and grace, we shall now more particularly shew,
how the habits of sin exert themselves in those who are unregenerate,
where there is no principle of grace to oppose them.
And then, how they exert themselves in believers; and what
opposition is made thereunto by the principle of grace in them;
and how it comes to pass that sometimes one prevails, at other
times the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We shall consider those violent efforts that are made by
corrupt nature, in those who are unregenerate, in whom, though
there be no principle of grace to enable them to withstand
them; yet they have a conflict in their own spirits. There is
something in nature, that, for a time, keeps them from complying
with temptations to the greatest sins; though the flesh,
or that propensity that is in them to sin, will prevail at last, and
lead them from one degree of impiety to another, unless prevented
by the grace of God. In this case the conflict is between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>corrupt nature and an enlightened conscience; and that
more especially in those who have had the advantage of a religious
education, and the good example of some whom they
have conversed with, whereby they have contracted some habits
of moral virtue, which are not immediately extinguished:
it is not an easy matter to persuade them to commit those gross,
and scandalous sins, which others, whose minds are blinded,
and their hearts hardened to a greater degree by the deceitfulness
of sin, commit with greediness and without remorse. The
principles of education are not immediately broken through;
for in this case men meet with a great struggle in their own
breasts, before they entirely lose them; and they proceed, by
various steps, from one degree of wickedness unto another<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.
A breach is first made in the fence, and afterwards widened by
a continuance in the same sins, or committing new ones, especially
such as have in them a greater degree of presumption.
And this disposes the soul to comply with temptations to greater
sins; whereas, it would be to no purpose to tempt him at
first, to be openly profane, blaspheme the name of God, or
cast off all external acts of religion, and abandon himself to
those immoralities which the most notoriously wicked, and
profligate sinners commit, without shame, till he has paved the
way to them by the commission of other sins that lead thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which at first prevents or restrains him from the commission
of them, is something short of a principle of grace
which we call the dictates of a natural conscience, which often
checks and reproves him: his natural temper or disposition is
not so far vitiated, at present as to allow of, or incline him to
pursue any thing that is openly vile and scandalous; he abhors,
and, as it were, trembles at the thoughts of it. Thus when
the prophet Elisha told Hazael of all the evil that he would
do unto the children of Israel, that he would <i>set their strong
holds on fire, slay their young men with a sword, dash their
children, and rip up their women with child</i>; when he heard
this, he entertained the thought with a kind of abhorrence, and
said, <i>But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this
great thing</i>, 2 Kings viii. 12, 13. Yet afterwards, when king
of Syria, we find him of another mind; for he was a greater
scourge to the people of God than any of the neighbouring
princes, and <i>smote them in all the coasts of Israel</i>, chap. x. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that which prevents these greater sins, is generally fear
or shame; their consciences terrify them with the thoughts of
the wrath of God, which they would hereby expose themselves
to; or they are apprehensive that such a course of life would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>blast their reputation amongst men, and be altogether inconsistent
with that form of godliness which they have had a liking
to from their childhood. But since these restraints do not
proceed from the internal and powerful influence of regenerating
grace, being excited by lower motives than those which
the Spirit of God suggests, in them who are converted; since
natural conscience is the main thing that restrains them, corrupt
nature first endeavours to counteract the dictates thereof,
and, by degrees, gets the mastery over them. When conscience
reproves them, they first offer a bribe to it, by performing
some moral duties, to silence its accusations for presumptuous
sins, and pretend that their crimes fall short of those
committed by many others; at other times they complain of
its being too strict in its demands of duty, or severe in its reproofs
for sin. And if all this will not prevail against it, but
it will, notwithstanding, perform the office of a faithful reprover,
then the sinner resolves to stop his ears against convictions;
and if this will not altogether prevent his being made uneasy
thereby, he betakes himself to those diversions that may give
another turn to his thoughts, and will not allow himself time
for serious reflection; and associates himself with those whose
conversation will effectually tend to extinguish all his former
impressions of moral virtue; and by this means, at last he stupifies
his conscience, and it becomes, as the apostle expresses it,
<i>seared with a hot iron</i>, 1 Tim. iv. 2. and so he gets, as I may
express it, a fatal victory over himself; and from that time
meets with no reluctancy or opposition in his own breast, while
<i>being past feeling, he gives himself over unto lasciviousness, to
work uncleanness</i>, and all manner of <i>iniquity with greediness</i>,
Eph. iv. 19. which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That conflict which is between the flesh and spirit, in
those in whom the work of sanctification is begun. Here we
shall first observe, the lustings of the flesh; and then the opposition
that it meets with from that principle of grace which
is implanted and excited in them, which is called the lusting
of the spirit against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) How corrupt nature exerts itself in believers, to prevent
the actings of grace. Here it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That that which gives occasion to this, is the Spirit’s
withdrawing his powerful influences, which, when the soul is
favoured with, have a tendency to prevent those pernicious
consequences which will otherwise ensue. And God withdraws
these powerful influences sometimes in a way of sovereignty,
to shew him that it is not in his own power to avoid sin when
he will; or that he cannot, without the aids of his grace, withstand
those temptations which are offered to him to commit it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Or else, he does this with a design to let him know what is in
his heart; and that he might take occasion to humble him for
past sins, or present miscarriages, and make him more watchful
for the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Besides this, there are some things which present themselves
in an objective way, which are as so many snares laid to
entangle him. And corrupt nature makes a bad improvement
thereof, so that his natural constitution is more and more vitiated
by giving way to sin, and defiled by the remainders of
sin that dwelleth in him. The temptation is generally adapted
to the corrupt inclination of his nature, and Satan has a hand
therein. Thus if his natural temper inclines him to be proud
or ambitious, then immediately the honours and applause of
the world are presented to him; and he never wants examples
of those, who, in an unlawful way, have gained a great measure
of esteem in the world, and made themselves considerable
in the stations in which they have been placed: if he is naturally
addicted to pleasures, of what kind soever they be, then
something is offered that is agreeable to corrupt nature, which
seems delightful to it; though it be in itself, sinful: if he be
more than ordinarily addicted to covetousness, then the profits
and advantages of the world are presented as a bait to corrupt
nature, and groundless fears raised in him, of being reduced
to poverty, which, by an immoderate pursuit after the world,
he is tempted to fence against. Moreover, if his natural constitution
inclines him to resent injuries, then Satan has always
his instruments ready at hand to stir up his corruption, and
provoke him to wrath, by offering either real or supposed injuries;
magnifying the former beyond their due bounds, or
inferring the latter without duly considering the design of those
whose innocent behaviour sometimes gives occasion hereunto,
and, at the same time, overcharging his thoughts with them,
as though no expedient can be found to atone for them. Again,
if his natural constitution inclines him to sloth and inactivity,
then the difficulties of religion are set before him, to discourage
him from the exercise of that diligence which is necessary to
surmount them. And if, on the other hand, his natural temper
leads him to be courageous and resolute, then corrupt nature
endeavours to make him self-confident, and thereby to weaken
his trust in God. Or if he be naturally inclined to fear, then
something is offered to him, that may tend to his discouragement,
and to sink him into despair. These are the methods
used by the flesh, when lusting against the spirit; which leads
us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The opposition of the spirit to the flesh; or how the
principle of grace in believers inclines them to make a stand
against indwelling sin, which is called the lusting of the spirit
against the flesh. The grace of God, when wrought in the heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>in regeneration, is not an unactive principle; for it soon exerts
itself, as being excited by the power of the Spirit, who implanted
it; and from that time there is, or ought to be, a constant
opposition made by it to corrupt nature; and that, not only as
the soul, with unfeigned repentance, mourns for it, and exercises
that self-abhorrence which the too great prevalence thereof
calls for; but as it leads him to implore help from God,
against it, by whose assistance he endeavours to subdue the
corrupt motions of the flesh; or, as the apostle expresses it, to
<i>mortify the deeds of the body</i>, Rom. viii. 13. that by this means
they may not be entertained, or prove injurious and destructive
to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And inasmuch as there is something objective, as well as
subjective, in this work; since the power of God never excites
the principle of grace without presenting objects for it to be
conversant about, there are several things suggested to the soul,
which, if duly weighed and improved, are a means conducive
to its being preserved from a compliance with the corrupt motions
of indwelling sin: these are of a superior nature to those
made use of by an enlightened conscience, in unregenerate persons,
to prevent their committing the vilest abominations, as
was before considered; and indeed, they are such as, from the
nature of the thing, can be used (especially some of them) by
none but those in whom the work of grace is begun. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] A believer considers not only the glorious excellencies
and perfections of Christ, which he is now duly sensible of, as
he is said to be precious to them that believe; but he is also
affected with the manifold engagements, which he has been
laid under to love him, and to hate and oppose every thing that
is contrary to his glory and interest. The love of Christ constraineth
him; and therefore he abhors the thoughts of being so
ungrateful and disingenuous as he would appear to be, should
he fulfil the lusts of the flesh: the sense of redeeming love and
grace is deeply impressed on his soul; he calls to mind how he
has been quickened, effectually called, and brought into the
way of peace and holiness, and therefore cannot entertain any
thoughts of relapsing or returning again to folly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here he considers the great advantage which he has received,
which he would not lose on any terms. The delight and
pleasure which he has had in the ways of God and godliness,
has been so great, that corrupt nature cannot produce any thing
that may be an equivalent for the loss of it. He is very sensible
that the more closely he has walked with God, the more
comfortably he has walked. And besides this, he looks forward,
and, by faith, takes a view of the blessed issue of the
life of grace, or those reserves of glory laid up for him in another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>world, which inclines him to cast the utmost contempt on
every thing that has the least tendency to induce him to relinquish
or abandon his interest therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] He considers and improves those bright examples which
are set before him, to encourage him to go on in the way of
holiness; takes Christ himself for a pattern, endeavouring, so
far as he is able, to follow him; walks as they have done, who
have not only stood their ground, but come off victorious
in the conflict, and are reaping the blessed fruits and effects
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] He also considers, as an inducement to him to oppose
the corrupt motions of the flesh; that he has by faith, as his
own act and deed, in the most solemn manner, given up himself
to Christ entirely, and without reserve, and professed his
obligation to obey him in all things, and to avoid whatever has
a tendency to displease him. And therefore he reckons that he
is not his own, or, at his own disposal, but Christ’s, whose he
is, by a double right, not only as purchased by, but as devoted
and consecrated to him; and therefore he says with the apostle,
<i>How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</i>
Rom. vi. 2. He says to this purpose, I have given up my name
to Christ; and I have not, since that time, seen the least reason
to repent of what I did; I have not found the least iniquity
in him, neither has he been an hard master; but, on the
other hand, has expressed the greatest tenderness and compassion
to me, to whose grace alone it is owing, that I am what I
am. Shall I therefore abandon his interest, or prove a deserter
at last, and turn aside into the enemies’ camp? Is there any
thing that can be proposed as a sufficient motive hereunto?
Such like thoughts as these, through the prevailing influence
of the principle of grace implanted and excited by the Spirit,
are an effectual means to keep him from a sinful compliance
with the motions of the flesh, and to excite him to make the
greatest resistance against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have considered the opposition that there is between
the flesh and spirit, and how each of these prevail by
turns; we might now observe the consequence of the victory
obtained on either side. When grace prevails, all things tend
to promote our spiritual peace and joy; we are hereby fortified
against temptations, and enabled, not only to stand our ground,
but made more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
However it is not always so with a believer; he sometimes
finds, that corrupt nature prevails, and then many sad consequences
will ensue hereupon, which not only occasion the loss
of that peace and joy which he had before; but expose him to
many troubles, which render his life very uncomfortable; and
this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>III. What are the consequences of the prevailing power of
indwelling sin. When the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and
God is pleased to withhold his grace, the soul is subjected to
many evils, which are mentioned in the remaining part of this
answer, as,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A believer is foiled with temptation. Satan gains ground
against him by this means, and pursues the victory which the
flesh has obtained against the spirit; hereupon his conflicts are
doubled, arising not only from <i>flesh and blood; but the rulers
of the darkness of this world</i>, Eph. vi. 12. as the apostle expresses
it: now his difficulties encrease upon him, his enemies
are more insulting, and he less able to stand his ground against
them, his faith weakened, and his fears encreasing, so that he
is perpetually subject to bondage; sometimes inclined to think
that he shall one day fall, and whatever he formerly thought
he had gained, he lost by the assaults of his spiritual enemies;
and at other times, to question whether ever he had the truth
of grace or no; in which case his spirit must needs be filled
with the greatest perplexity, and almost overwhelmed within
him. And he is destitute of that boldness or liberty of access
to the throne of grace, and that comfortable sense which once
he had of his interest in Christ, and finds it very difficult to
recover those lively frames which he has lost, or to stand his
ground against the great opposition made by corrupt nature,
which still increases as faith grows weaker.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another consequence hereof, is his falling into many sins.
By which we are not to suppose that he shall be so far left as
to fall into a state of unregeneracy, or lose the principle of grace
that was implanted in regeneration: nevertheless, when this
principle does not exert itself, and corrupt nature on the other
hand, is prevalent, it is hard to say how far he will run into the
commission of known and wilful sins. As for sins of infirmity,
they cannot be avoided, when we are in the best frame: but in
this case we shall find a person committing presumptuous sins,
so that if we were to judge of his state by his present frames,
without considering the former experiences which he has had
of the grace of God, we should be ready to question, whether
his heart were right with God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for sins of omission, these generally ensue hereupon;
he cannot draw nigh to God, with that frame of spirit, which
he once had, and therefore is ready to say, <i>What profit should
I have if I pray unto him?</i> Job xxi. 15. and sometimes concludes,
that he contracts guilt by attempting to engage in holy
duties. And to this we may add, that he is hindered in all his
spiritual services, as it is farther observed in this answer: thus
the apostle says, <i>When I would do good, evil is present with
me</i>, Rom. vii. 21. He finds his heart disposed to wander from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>God, and his thoughts taken up with vanity; upon which account
it may be truly said, that his best works are not only imperfect,
but defiled in the sight of God, who searcheth the heart,
and observes the various steps by which it treacherously departs
from him, and can find no way to recover itself till he is
pleased to revive his work, take away the guilt which he has
contracted, recover him out of the snare into which he has
fallen, and so cause the work of grace again to flourish in the
soul, as it has once done.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall conclude with some inferences from what has been
said concerning the imperfection of sanctification in believers,
together with the reasons and consequences thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Since sinless perfection is not attainable in this life, we
should from hence take occasion to give a check to our censorious
thoughts concerning persons or things, so as not to determine
persons to be in an unconverted state, because they are
chargeable with many sinful infirmities, which are not inconsistent
with the truth of grace: some abatements are to be made
for their being sanctified but in part, and having the remnants
of sin in them; and indeed, the greatest degree of grace which
can be attained here, comes far short of that which the saints
are arrived to in heaven; accordingly the difference between a
believer and an unregenerate sinner is not in that one is perfect,
and the other imperfect; for when we consider the brightest
characters given of any in scripture, their blemishes as well
as their graces are recorded; so that none but our Saviour
could challenge the world to convict or reprove them of sin.
The apostle speaks of Elias, as a <i>man subject to like passions as
we are</i>, James v. 17. and he might have instanced in many
others. Therefore, when we are sensible of our own imperfections,
we ought to enquire, whether the spots we find in ourselves,
are like the spots of God’s children? or, whether these
infirmities may be reckoned inconsistent with the truth of grace?
which, if they be, though it affords matter for humiliation, that
we are liable to any sinful failures, or defects; yet it will be
some encouragement to us, and matter of thanksgiving to God,
that notwithstanding this, our hearts are right with him. That
we may be, in some measure, satisfied as to this matter, let it
be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That we must distinguish between a person’s being
tempted to the greatest sins, which are inconsistent with the
truth of grace; and his complying with the temptation. A
temptation of this kind may offer itself, and at the same time
grace may exert itself in an eminent degree, by the opposition
that it makes to it, whether it arises from indwelling sin, or
Satan.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When we read of some sins that are inconsistent with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the truth of grace, such as those which the apostle speaks of,
when he says, that <i>neither fornicators nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
shall inherit the kingdom of God</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.
and elsewhere, <i>the fearful and unbelieving</i>, as well as those
who are guilty of other notorious crimes, are said to <i>have their
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone</i>, Rev.
xxi. 8. We must distinguish between those who are guilty
of these sins in a less degree than what is intended, when they
are said to exclude from the kingdom of heaven; and others
being guilty thereof, in a notorious degree, with greater aggravations:
Thus unbelieving fears in those who are called to
suffer for Christ’s sake, if they do not issue in a denial of him,
are not altogether inconsistent with the truth of grace, though
they render a person guilty before God. And the least degree
of covetousness, though it is not to be excused, yet it does not
exclude from the kingdom of heaven; but the prevailing love
of the world, or the immoderate pursuit of it in those who use
unlawful means to attain it, or have a rooted habitual desire
after it, more than Christ, or put it in his room, this is to be
reckoned a mark of unregeneracy.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] We must distinguish between sinful infirmities and allowed
infirmities, or such who sin through surprize, as being
assaulted by an unforseen temptation, when not being on their
guard; and the same sin committed with deliberation; the latter
gives greater ground to fear that a person is in a state of
unregeneracy than the former.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must also distinguish between sins committed and repented
of, with that degree of godly sorrow which is proportioned
to their respective aggravations; and the same sins committed
and continued in with impenitency; the latter gives
ground to conclude, that a person is in an unconverted state,
though not the former. And the difference arises not barely
from the nature of the crimes, for we suppose the sins in themselves
to be the same; but from other evidences which a person
has or has not of his being in a state of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. From what has been said concerning the opposition that
there is between natural conscience and corrupt nature in the
unregenerate, we may infer; that it is a great blessing to have
a religious education, as it has a tendency to prevent many
enormities, which others, who are destitute of it, run into: Accordingly
they who have had this privilege ought to bless God
for, and make a right improvement of it. But since those principles
which take their rise from thence, are liable, without the
grace of God prevent it, to be overcome and lost; let us press
after something more than this, and be importunate with God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>whose providence has favoured us thus far, that he would give
us a better preservative against sin, or that the prevailing power
thereof may be prevented by converting grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. From the opposition that corrupt nature makes in believers
to the work of grace, we may infer that the standing of
the best of men, or their not being chargeable with the greatest
sins, is not so much owing to themselves as to the grace of
God, by which we are what we are, and therefore the glory
thereof belongs intirely to him; and that we have reason, when
we are praying against our spiritual enemies, to beg that God
would deliver us from the greatest of them, namely, ourselves;
and that he, who has a sovereignty over the hearts of all men,
and can govern and sanctify their natural tempers and dispositions,
would keep us from being drawn aside thereby. This
should also induce us to walk watchfully, and to be always on
our guard, depending on the grace of God for help, that indwelling
sin may not so far prevail as to turn aside and alienate
our affections from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. From what has been said concerning the flesh and spirit
prevailing by turns, we infer the uncertainty of the frame of our
spirits, and what changes we are liable to, with respect to the
actings of grace, or the comforts that result from it. This
somewhat resembles the state of man as subject to various changes,
with respect to the dispensations of providence; sometimes
lifted up, at other times cast down, and not abiding long in the
same condition: Thus we are enabled, at some times, to gain
advantage over indwelling sin, and enjoy the comforts which
arise from thence; at other times, when the flesh prevails, the
acts of grace are interrupted, and its comforts, almost, if not
entirely lost. What reason have we therefore to bless God,
that though our graces are far from being brought to perfection,
and our frames so various; yet he has given us ground to
conclude, that grace shall not wholly be lost, and we are assured,
that our state, as we are justified, is not liable to the
same uncertainty, so that that which interrupts the progress of
sanctification, does not bring us into an unjustified state, or
render us liable to condemnation?</p>

<p class='c006'>5. From the inconveniences we sustain by the flesh prevailing
against the spirit, as we are foiled by temptation, fall into sins
and are hindered in spiritual services, we infer the great hurt
that sin does to those who are in a justified and sanctified state,
as well as to others, who are under the dominion of it. And
therefore it is a vile and unwarrantable way of speaking which
some use, who say, that because nothing shall separate them
from the love of Christ, or bring them who are justified, back
again into an unjustified state, that therefore sin can do them
no hurt; as though all the consequences of the prevalency of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>corrupt nature, and the dishonour we bring to God, and the
guilt we contract hereby, could hardly be reckoned prejudicial;
but this is such a way of speaking as confutes itself in the opinion
of all judicious and sober Christians.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we might also infer, from the consequences of the
prevalency of corruption, as we are liable hereby to be discouraged
from, or hindered in the performance of duty; that we
ought, if we find it thus with us, to take occasion from hence
to enquire, whether some secret sin be not indulged and entertained
by us, which gives occasion to the prevalency of corrupt
nature, which we ought to be humbled for. Or if we have
lived in the omission of those duties which are incumbent on
us, or have provoked God to leave us to ourselves, and so have
had an hand in our present evils; this affords matter of great
humiliation. And we ought to be very importunate with God
for restoring grace, not only that our faith may not fail; but
that we may be recovered out of the snare in which we are entangled,
and may be brought off victorious over all our spiritual
enemies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-79' class='c003'>Quest. LXXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> LXXIX. <i>May not true believers, by reason of their
imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken
with, fall away from the state of grace?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of
God, and his decree and covenant to give them perseverance,
their inseparable union with Christ, his continual intercession
for them, and the Spirit and seed of God abiding
in them, can neither totally nor finally fall from the state of
grace, but are kept by the power of God, through faith unto
salvation.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is natural for persons, when they enjoy any blessing, to
be solicitous about their retaining it; otherwise the pleasure
that arises from it; if it is like to be short and transitory,
is rather an amusement than a solid and substantial happiness.
The same may be said of those graces and privileges which
believers are made partakers of, as the fruits and effects of the
death of Christ: These are undoubtedly the most valuable
blessings; therefore it highly concerns us to enquire; whether
we may assuredly conclude, that we shall not lose them, and
so fail of that future blessedness which we have had so delightful
a prospect of?</p>

<p class='c006'>The saints’ perseverance has not only been denied by many
since the reformation, and, in particular, by Papists, Socinians,
and Remonstrants: But by the Pelagians of old; and all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>whose sentiments bear some affinity to, or are derived from
their scheme. And, indeed, when we find persons endeavouring
to establish the doctrine of conditional election, universal
redemption, &amp;c. or when they explain the nature of human
liberty, as they do, who make the grace of God to be dependent
on it for its efficacy in the beginning and carrying on the
work of conversion and sanctification; and accordingly assert,
that the will has an equal power to determine itself to good or
evil; or, that the grace of God affords no other assistance to
promote the one or fence against the other, than what is objective,
or, at least, by supporting our natural faculties; and if
there be any divine concourse, that it consists only in what respects
the external dispensations of providence, as a remote
means conducive thereunto, the event hereof depending on
our own conduct or disposition to improve these means: I
say, if persons maintain these and such-like doctrines, it is not
to be wondered, when we find them pleading for the possibility
of a believer’s falling totally and finally from the grace of
God. For they who have brought themselves into a state of
grace, may apostatize, or fall from it. If the free-will of man
first inclined itself to exercise those graces which we call special,
such as faith, repentance, love to God, &amp;c. then it will
follow, that he may lose them and relapse to the contrary vices;
and by this means men may plunge themselves into the same
depths of sin and misery from whence they had before escaped;
and, according to this scheme, there may be, in the course of
our lives, a great many instances of defection from the grace
of God, and recovery to it, and finally, a drawing back unto
perdition: Or if a person be so happy as to recover himself
out of his last apostacy before he leaves the world, then he is
saved; otherwise he finally perishes. This is a doctrine which
some defend, the contrary whereunto we shall endeavour to
maintain, as being the subject insisted on in this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>But before we proceed to the defence thereof, it may not
be amiss to premise something, which may have, at least, a
remote tendency to dispose us to receive conviction from the
arguments which may be brought to prove it. Thus we may
consider that the contrary side of the question is in itself less
desirable, if it could be defended. It is certain, that the doctrine
of the possibility of the saints falling from grace, tends
very much to abate that delight and comfort which the believer
has in the fore-views of the issue and event of his present
state. It is a very melancholy thought to consider, that he
who is now advanced to the very borders of heaven, may be
cast down into hell; or that, though he has at present an interest
in the special and discriminating love of God, he may
afterwards become the object of his hatred, so as never to behold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>his face with joy in a future world; or that, though his
feet are set upon a rock, yet his goings are not established;
though he is walking in a plain and safe path, yet he may be
ensnared, entangled, and fall, so as never to rise again; that
though God be his friend, yet he may suffer him to fall into
the hands of his enemies, and be ruined and undone thereby,
as though his own glory were not concerned in his coming off
victorious over them, or connected with the salvation of his
people: So that as this doctrine renders the state of believers
very precarious and uncertain, it tends effectually to damp
their joys, and blast their expectations, and subject them to
perpetual bondage; and it is a great hindrance to their offering
praise and thanksgiving to God, whose grace is not so much
magnified towards them, as it would be, had they ground to
conclude that the work which is now begun, should certainly
be brought to perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>And on the other hand, the doctrine which we are to maintain,
is in itself so very comfortable, that if we were, at present,
in suspense concerning the truth thereof, we cannot but
desire that it may appear to be agreeable to the mind of God:
It is certainly a very delightful thing for us to be assured, that
what is at present well, shall end well; that they who are
brought to believe in Christ, shall for ever abide with him;
and that the work of grace, which, at present, affords so fair
and pleasing a prospect of its being at last perfected in glory,
shall not miscarry. This will have a tendency to enhance our
joy in proportion to the ground we have to conclude that the
work is true and genuine; and it will excite our thankfulness
to God, when we consider, that he who is the author, will also
be the finisher of faith: So that it is certain this doctrine deserves
confirmation; and accordingly we shall endeavour to
establish our faith therein in the following method:</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider what we are to understand by persevering
in grace, or falling from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall prove, that the best believers would certainly
fall from grace, were they left to themselves: So that their
perseverance therein, is principally to be ascribed to the power
of God, which keeps them, through faith, unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We shall consider, what ground we have to conclude
that the saints shall persevere in grace; and so explain and illustrate
the several arguments insisted on in this answer; to
which we shall add some others taken from several scriptures
by which this doctrine may be defended.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall endeavour to answer some objections that are
generally brought against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We shall consider what we are to understand by persevering
in grace, or falling from it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>1. When we speak of a person as persevering in grace, this
supposes that he has the truth of grace. We do not hereby
intend that a person may not fall away from a profession of
faith; or that no one can lose that which we generally call
common grace, which, in many things, bears a resemblance to
that which is saving. We have before considered, that there
is a temporary faith, whereby persons appear religious, while
it comports with their secular interest; but when they are called
by reason of persecution or tribulation, which may arise for
the sake of the gospel, to forego their worldly interests, or quit
their pretensions to religion, they fall away, or lose that grace
which they <i>seemed to have</i>, as the Evangelist expresses it,
Luke viii. 18. We read of some whose hope of salvation is
like the spider’s web, or the giving up of the ghost; but these
are described not as true believers, but hypocrites. It is beyond
dispute that such may apostatize, and not only lay aside
the external practice of some religious duties, but deny and
oppose the doctrines of the gospel, which they once assented
to the truth of.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is certain that true believers may fall into very great
sins; but yet they shall be recovered and brought again to repentance:
therefore we must distinguish between their dishonouring
Christ, disobeying his commands, and thereby provoking
him to be angry with him; and their falling away totally
from him. We have before considered, when we proved
that perfection is not attainable in this life, that the best men
are sometimes chargeable with great failings and defects. And
indeed, sometimes their sins are very heinously aggravated,
their conversation in the mean while discovering that they are
destitute of the actings of grace, and that to such a degree that
they can hardly be distinguished from those who are in an unregenerate
state: accordingly it is one thing for a believer not
to be able to put forth those acts of grace which he once did;
and another thing for him to lose the principle of grace: it
would be a very preposterous thing to say, that when David
sinned in the matter of Uriah, the principle of grace exerted
itself; yet it was not wholly lost. It is not the same in this
case, as in the more common instances of the saints’ infirmities,
which they are daily chargeable with, in which, the conflict
that there is between the flesh and spirit appears; for
when corrupt nature exerts itself in such a degree that it leads
persons to the commission of deliberate and presumptuous sins,
they hardly appear to be believers at that time: nevertheless if
we compare what they were before they fell, with what they
shall be when brought to repentance, we may conclude, that
they did not, by their fall, bring themselves altogether into a
state of unregeneracy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>3. It is beyond dispute, that as a believer may be destitute
of the acts of grace; so he may lose the comforts thereof, and
sink into the depths of despair. Of this we have several instances
recorded in scripture, which are agreeable to the experiences
of many in our day: thus the Psalmist, at one time,
speaks of himself, as <i>cast down</i>, and <i>his soul disquieted within
him</i>, Psal. xliii. 5. and cxvi. 3. And at another time he says,
<i>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
hold upon me.</i> And elsewhere he complains, <i>Will the Lord cast
off for ever? will he be favourable no more? is his mercy clean
gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? hath God
forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
mercies</i>, Psal. lxxvii. 7-9. And again, a believer is represented
as being altogether destitute of a comfortable sense of
the divine love, when complaining, <i>Thou hast laid me in the
lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. Thy wrath lieth hard upon
me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Wilt thou
shew wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise thee?
Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave, or thy faithfulness
in destruction? Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy
terrors have cut me off</i>, Psal. lxxxviii. 6. <i>&amp;c.</i> And it is certain,
that when at any time he falls into very great sins, which
seem inconsistent with a state of grace, he has no present evidence
that he is a believer; and is never favoured with a comfortable
sense of his interest in Christ, nor is the joy of God’s
salvation restored to him, till he is brought unfeignedly to repent
of his sin. Former experiences will not evince the truth
of grace, while he remains impenitent. It is a bad sign when
any one, who formerly appeared to have the truth of grace,
but is now fallen into great sins, concludes himself to be in a
state of grace, without the exercise of true repentance; for
this can be deemed little better than presumption: however,
God, whose mercy is infinitely above our deserts, will, in the
end, recover him; though, at present, he does not look like
one of his children.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There are some who suppose that a believer may fall totally,
though not finally from grace. And their reason for it
is this; because they conclude, as they have sufficient warrant
to do, from scripture, that they shall not fall finally, inasmuch
as the purpose of God concerning election, must stand; if they
had not been chosen to salvation they would never have been
brought into a state of grace: they are supposed, before they
fell, to have been sanctified; whereas sanctification is inseparably
connected with salvation; and therefore, though they
consider them, at this time, as having lost the grace of sanctification,
and so to have fallen totally; yet they shall be recovered,
and therefore not fall finally. Sanctification is Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>purchase; and where grace is purchased for any one, a price
of redemption is paid for his deliverance from condemnation;
and consequently he shall be recovered and saved at last,
though, at present, he is, according to their opinion, totally
fallen.</p>

<p class='c006'>These suppose, not only that the acts of grace may be lost,
but the very principle, and the reason hereof is, because they
cannot see, how great and notorious sins, such as those committed
by David, Peter, Solomon, and some others, can consist
with a principle of grace: this indeed cuts the knot of some
difficulties that seem to attend the doctrine of the saints perseverance,
though falling into great sins: nevertheless, I think
it may easily be proved, which we shall endeavour to do, that
they shall be preserved from a total, as well as a final apostacy:
or, that when they fall into great sins, they do not lose the
principle of grace, though it be, at present, innactive; which
we shall take occasion to insist on, more particularly under a
following head, when we consider that argument mentioned in
this answer for the proof of this doctrine taken from the Spirit
and seed of God abiding in a believer, as that which preserves
him from a total as well as a final apostacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall now consider, that the best believers would
certainly fall from grace, were they left to themselves: so that
their perseverance therein is principally to be ascribed to the
power of God, that keeps them through faith unto salvation.
This is particularly observed in this answer, in which several
arguments are laid down to prove the doctrine of the saints’
perseverance in grace, and it is supposed to be founded on his
power, and will, to maintain it. God is styled <i>the preserver
of men</i>, Job vii. 20. inasmuch as he upholds all things by the
word of his power, so that independency on him is inconsistent
with the idea of our being creatures; and we have no less
ground to conclude, that his power maintains the new creature,
or that grace, which took its first rise from him. Should he
fail or forsake us, we could not put forth the least act of grace,
much less persevere therein. When man at first came out of
the hands of God, he was endowed with a greater ability to
stand than any one, excepting our Saviour, has been favoured
with, since sin entered into the world; yet he apostatized, not
from any necessity of nature, but by adhering to that temptation
which he might have withstood. Then how unable is he
to stand in his present state, who is become weak, and, though
brought into a state of grace, renewed and sanctified but in
part; having still the remainders of corruption, which maintain
a constant opposition to the principle of grace? Our perseverance
in grace cannot therefore be owing to ourselves; accordingly
the apostle ascribes this to a divine hand, when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>says, that <i>we are kept by the power of God through faith unto
salvation</i>, 1 Pet. i. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>A late celebrated writer, on the other side of the question,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
attempts to evade the force of this argument to prove the doctrine
of perseverance, though I think, without much strength
of reasoning, when he says; that all who are preserved to
salvation, are kept by the power of God, but not that all believers
are so kept.</p>

<p class='c006'>To which it may be replied, that all believers, whose character
answers that of the church, to which the apostle writes,
shall be saved; namely, all who are <i>begotten again unto a lively
hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, to an inheritance
incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved
in heaven for them</i>; whose <i>faith</i>, after it has been tried, shall
be <i>found unto praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing
of Jesus Christ</i>, 1 Pet. i. 3, 4, 7. I say, these shall certainly
be saved: therefore, if all who are thus preserved to salvation,
are kept by the power of God, this is all we need contend for.
And whereas he adds, that when they are said to be kept
through faith, the meaning is, they are kept, if they continue
in the faith. To this it may be replied, That their continuance
in the faith was put out of all dispute, by what is said
concerning them in the words going before and following, as
row referred to. And as to his argument, it amounts to no
more than this; that they shall be kept by the power of God,
if they keep themselves; or they shall persevere if they persevere,
to which I need make no reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since our main design in this head is not to prove that
believers shall persevere, which we reserve to our next; but
to shew that whatever we assert concerning their perseverance,
take its rise from God; we shall consider this as plainly contained
in scripture. Accordingly the apostle speaks of the
Lord’s <i>delivering him from every evil work, and preserving him
to his heavenly kingdom</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 18. Jude, ver. 1. and the
apostle Jude speaks of believers as <i>sanctified by God the Father,
and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called</i>, or as being first
called, and then preserved by God the Father, through the intervention
of Christ, our great Mediator, till they are brought
to glory. And our Saviour, in his affectionate prayer for his
church, a little before he left the world, says, <i>Holy Father,
keep, through thine own name, those whom thou hast given
me</i>, John xvii. 11. which not only proves that the perseverance
of the saints is owing to God, but that the glory of his own
name is concerned herein; therefore it is not from ourselves,
but him: and there is another scripture, in which our Saviour,
speaks of the perseverance of his <i>sheep</i> in grace, and of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>giving them eternal life, and adds, that <i>they shall never perish,
neither shall any pluck them out of his hand</i>, chap. x. 28. therefore
it is owing to his care, as the great Shepherd of the sheep,
and to his power, that is superior to that of all those who attempt
to destroy them, that they shall persevere in grace. And
this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What ground we have to conclude that the saints shall
persevere in grace, and so explain and illustrate the arguments
insisted on in this answer, together with some others that may
be taken from the sense of several scriptures, by which this
doctrine may be defended.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The saints’ perseverance in grace may be proved from the
unchangeable love of God, and his decree and purpose, relating
to their salvation, in which it is discovered and executed.
That God loved them with a love of good-will, before they
were inclined to express any love to him, is evident; because
their love to him is assigned as the effect and consequence of
his love to them, as the apostle says, <i>We love him because he
first loved us</i>, 1 John iv. 19. Therefore this love of God to
his people, must be considered as an immanent act; from
whence it follows, that it was from eternity, since all God’s
immanent acts are eternal: and this is particularly expressed
by the prophet, when he says, <i>The Lord hath appeared of old
unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting
love</i>, Jer. xxxi. 3. If this be meant of a love that shall never
have an end, it plainly proves the doctrine we are defending;
but inasmuch as the words that immediately follow, <i>Therefore,
with loving kindness have I drawn thee</i>, seem to intimate that
this everlasting love is that which was from everlasting; as his
drawing them or bringing them into a converted state is the
result hereof: therefore this everlasting love is the same as his
eternal purpose, or design to save them. If there be such an
eternal purpose relating to their salvation, this necessarily infers
their perseverance; and that there was such a design in
God has been already proved under a foregoing answer<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a>. And
they who are the objects of this eternal purpose of grace are
frequently described, in scripture, as believers, inasmuch as
faith and salvation are inseparably connected together; therefore,
the execution of God’s purpose in giving faith, necessarily
infers the execution thereof, in saving them that believe.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this purpose of grace is unchangeable, has been before
proved<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a>; and may be farther argued from what the apostle
speaks concerning <i>the immutability of his counsel</i>, shewn to the
<i>heirs of promise</i>, as the ground of that <i>strong consolation</i> which
they have <i>who are flying for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
before them</i>, Heb. vi. 17, 18. Therefore, if God cannot change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>his purpose, relating to the salvation of believers, it necessarily
follows, that they shall certainly attain this salvation, and
consequently, that they shall persevere in grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> To this it will be objected, that though God may be
said to love his people, while they retain their integrity, yet
they may provoke him by their sins to cast them off; therefore
the present exercise of divine love to them is no certain
argument that it shall be extended to the end, so as that, by
virtue hereof, he will enable them to persevere, and then bring
them to glory.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that we do not deny that
believers, by their sins, may provoke God so far, as that, if he
should mark their iniquities, or deal with them according to
the demerit thereof, he would cast them off for ever; but this
he will not do, because it is inconsistent with his purpose to
recover them from their backslidings, and forgive their iniquities.
Moreover, it cannot be denied, that, notwithstanding
God’s eternal love to them, there are many instances of his hatred
and displeasure expressed in the external dispensations of
his providence, which are as often changed, as their conduct
towards him is changed; but this does not infer a change in
God’s purpose: he may testify his displeasure against them,
or as the Psalmist expresses it, <i>Visit their transgressions with
the rod, and their iniquities with stripes</i>, Psal. lxxxix. 32.
Nevertheless he cannot change his resolution to save them;
and therefore, by some methods of grace, he will recover them
from their backslidings, and enable them to persevere in grace,
since his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another argument to prove the saints’ perseverance, may
be taken from the covenant of grace, and the many promises
respecting their salvation, which are contained therein. That
this may appear, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That Christ was appointed to be the head of this covenant,
as was observed in a foregoing answer<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a>; and accordingly
there was an eternal transaction between the Father and
him; in which, all things were stipulated in the behalf of his
elect, whom he therein represented, which relate to their everlasting
salvation. In this covenant God the Father, not only
promised that he should <i>have a seed to serve him</i>, Psal. xxii.
30. but that he <i>should see his seed</i>; and that <i>the pleasure of the
Lord</i>, with relation to them, <i>should prosper in his hand</i>; that
he should <i>see of the travel of his soul, and be satisfied</i>, Isa. liii.
10, 11. which implies, that he should see the fruits and effects
of all that he had done and suffered for them, in order to their
salvation; and this is not spoken of some of them, but of all;
and it could not have had its accomplishment, were it possible
for them not to persevere in grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>(2.) In this covenant, Christ has undertaken to keep them,
as the result of his becoming a Surety for them, in which he
not only engaged to pay the debt of obedience and sufferings
that was due from them, which he has already done; but that
he would work all that grace in them which he purchased by
his blood; and he has already begun this work in them which
is not yet accomplished: can we therefore suppose that he will
not bring it to perfection, nor enable them to endure to the end,
that they may be saved, which would argue the greatest unfaithfulness
in him, who is styled Faithful and True?</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as there are engagements on Christ’s part, relating
hereunto, and in pursuance thereof, they are said to be in
his hand; so the Father has given them an additional security,
that they shall be preserved from apostasy; and therefore they
are also said to be <i>in his hand</i>; from whence <i>none can pluck
them out</i>; and from thence it is argued, that <i>they shall never
perish</i>, John x. 28, 29. And we may observe, that the life
which Christ is said to give them respects not only the beginning
thereof, in the first grace which they are made partakers
of in conversion; but it is called <i>eternal life</i>, which certainly
denotes the completing of this work in their everlasting salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The subject-matter of the promises contained in the covenant
of grace, relates not only to their sanctification here, but
salvation hereafter; in which respect it is called <i>an everlasting
covenant</i>, and the mercies thereof, <i>the sure mercies of David</i>,
Isa. lv. 3, 4. that is, either those mercies which David, who
had an interest in this covenant, was given to expect; or mercies
which Christ had engaged to purchase and bestow, who is
here called David, as elsewhere, Hos. iii. 5. inasmuch as David
was an eminent type of him, as well as because he was his
seed according to the flesh; and that this is the more probable
sense of the two, appears from the following words, in
which he is said to be <i>given for a witness to the people, a leader
and commander to the people</i>: and if these mercies are in
Christ’s hand to apply, it is no wonder that they are styled
<i>sure mercies</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here consider the covenant of grace as containing
in it all the promises that respect the beginning, carrying
on, or completing the salvation of his people; and these relate
not only to what God will do for them; but what he will enable
them to be, and do, in those things that concern their faithfulness
to him, whereby they have the highest security that
they shall behave themselves as becomes a covenant-people.
Thus he assures them, that he will be to them a God, that is,
that he will glorify his divine perfections in bestowing on them
the special and distinguishing blessings of the covenant; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>that they shall be to him a people, that is, shall behave themselves
so as that they shall not, by apostacy from him, oblige
him to disown his relation to them, or exclude them from his
covenant. He has not only encouraged them to expect those
great things that he would do for them, provided they yielded
obedience to his law; but that he would <i>put his law into their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts</i>, whereby they might
be disposed to obey him: and when he says, that they <i>shall
teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,
saying, Know the Lord</i>, he gives them to understand that
they should not only teach or instruct one other in the knowledge
of God, which respects their being favoured with the
external means of grace; but that they <i>should all know him,
from the least of them unto the greatest</i>. This not only denotes
that they should have a speculative knowledge of divine truth,
but a saving knowledge thereof; which is inseparably connected
with <i>life eternal</i>, John xvii. 3. as appears from its being
accompanied with, or flowing from forgiveness of sin, as it
immediately follows; <i>for I will forgive their iniquity</i>; and
this is expressed with a peculiar emphasis, which is certainly
inconsistent with their falling from a justified state, when it is
said, <i>I will remember their sin no more</i>, Jer. xxxi. 33, 34. And
elsewhere, when God speaks of his <i>making an everlasting covenant</i>
with his people, chap. xxxii. 40. he promises that <i>he
will not turn away from them to do them good</i>; and, inasmuch
as they are prone, by reason of the deceitfulness of their hearts,
to turn aside from him, he adds, <i>I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me</i>; it is not only said
that he will not turn from them, if they fear him; but he gives
them security in this covenant, that they shall fear him: can
we therefore conclude that they, in whom this covenant is so
far made good, that God has put his fear in their hearts, which
is supposed in their being believers, shall not attain the other
blessing promised, to wit, that of their not departing from him?</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the stability of this covenant, as a foundation of
the saints’ perseverance, is set forth by a metaphor, taken from
the most fixed and stable parts of nature; and it is said to exceed
them herein; <i>The mountains shall depart and the hills be
removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee; neither
shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord, that
hath mercy on thee</i>, Isa. liv. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> The principal objection that is brought to enervate
the force of this argument taken from those promises of the
covenant, which respect the saints’ perseverance, is, that they
are to be considered either as conditional, and the conditions
thereof not fulfilled, in which case they are not obliging, and
therefore God is not bound to give salvation to those to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>he has promised it, upon these conditions; or else they are to
be considered as made to a political body, <i>viz.</i> the Jewish nation,
in which case it is not to be supposed that they respect
their eternal salvation, but only some temporal deliverance
which they were to be made partakers of, that belonged to that
church in general; for everlasting salvation is never considered
as a blessing that shall be applied to whole nations, how much
soever an whole nation may partake of the common gifts of
divine bounty which are bestowed in this world.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In answer to this objection, in both its branches, I
need only refer to what has been said elsewhere. As to the
former branch thereof, we have endeavoured to shew how those
scriptures are to be understood which are laid down in a conditional
form, without supposing that they militate against the
absoluteness of God’s purpose, or its unchangeableness, and
independency on the conduct of men.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> And as to the latter
branch thereof; what has been said in answer to an objection
of the like nature, brought against the doctrine of election by
Dr. Whitby, and others, who suppose that the blessings, which
the elect are said to be made partakers of in scripture, respect
the nation of the Jews, or the church in general, and not a particular
number chosen out of them to salvation; and that the
promises which are directed to them, are only such as they
were given to expect, as a church or political body of men,
may well be applied to our present purpose, and serve as an
answer to this objection;<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a> therefore all that I shall add by way
of reply to it, in this place, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] If any thing be annexed to these promises of the covenant,
that gives occasion for some to conclude, that it is conditional,
we must take heed that we do not understand such
expressions as denoting the dependance of God’s determinations
on the arbitrary will of man; as though his purpose relating
to the salvation of his people were indeterminate, and it
were a matter of doubt with him, as well as with us, whether
he should fulfil it or no; because it is uncertain whether the
conditions thereof shall be performed; for this supposition is
inconsistent with the divine perfections: but, if, on the other
hand, we suppose that the grace or duty annexed to the promise,
must have some idea of a condition contained in it; this
may be understood according to the tenor of God’s revealed
will, as denoting nothing else but a condition of our expectation,
or of our claim to the blessing promised; and then nothing
can be inferred from hence, but that some who lay claim
to, or expect salvation, without performing the condition thereof,
may apostatize, and so miss of it; which does not in the
least militate against the doctrine we are defending.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>And to this we may farther add, that when such a condition
is annexed to a promise (for I will not decline to call it so,
in the sense but now laid down) and there is another promise
added, in which God engages that he will enable them to perform
this condition, that is equivalent to an absolute promise;
and of this kind are those conditions that are mentioned in the
scriptures before referred to, as has been already observed.
When God promises that he will be a God to them, that he
will forgive their iniquities, and never reverse the sentence of
forgiveness, or remember their sins no more, and that he will
never turn away from them to do them good; he, at the same
time promises, that he will put his law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts, and put his fear in their hearts, and
so enable them to behave themselves as his people, or to be
to him a people; and when God sets forth the stability of his
covenant, and intimates that it should not be removed, he adds,
that his kindness shall not depart from them, which kindness
does not barely respect some temporal blessings which he
would bestow upon them, but his extending that grace to them
that should keep them faithful to him; and therefore he says,
<i>that in righteousness they should be established</i>; which contains
a promise to maintain grace in them, without which they
could hardly be said to be established in righteousness, as well
as that he would perform the other things promised to them in
this covenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] As to the other branch of the objection, in which the
promises are considered as given to the church in general, or
to the Jews, as a political body of men; and that this cannot be
supposed to respect their everlasting salvation, but only some
temporal blessings which they should enjoy, it may be replied,
That this is to be determined by the express words contained
in the promise: if God tells them that he will do that for them
which includes more in it than the blessings which they are
supposed to enjoy, that are of a temporal nature, we are not to
conclude that there is nothing of salvation contained in them,
when the words seem to imply that there is. And though these
promises are said to be given to the Jews, as a political body
of men, and there are some circumstances therein, which have
an immediate and particular relation to them: yet the promises
of special grace and salvation were to be applied only by
those who believed amongst them; and the same promises are
to be applied by believers in all ages; or else we must understand
those scriptures only as an historical relation of things
that do not belong to us; which would tend very much to
detract from the spirituality and usefulness of many parts of
scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make this appear, we might consider some promises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>which, when first made, had a particular relation to God’s
dealings with his people in those circumstances in which they
were at that time; which, notwithstanding, are applied in a
more extensive manner, to New Testament believers in all
ages. Thus when God tells his people, in the scripture before
referred to, that <i>all thy children shall be taught of the Lord</i>,
Isa. liv. 13. whatever respect this may have to the church of the
Jews, our Saviour applies it in a more extensive way, as belonging
to believers in all ages, when he says, <i>Every man therefore
that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me</i>, John
vi. 45. And when God promises Joshua that <i>he would not fail
nor forsake him</i>, and encourages him thereby, <i>not to fear nor
be dismayed</i>, Josh. i. 5, 9. when he was to pass over Jordan,
into the land of Canaan; and after that, to engage in a work
which was attended with many difficulties: this promise is applied,
by the apostle, as an inducement to believers, in his day,
to be <i>content with such things as they have</i>; accordingly he
adds, that what God told Joshua of old, the same was written
for their encouragement, <i>viz.</i> that <i>he would never leave them,
nor forsake them</i>, Heb. xiii. 5. We cannot therefore but conclude
from hence, that this objection is of no force in either of
its branches, to overthrow the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance,
as founded on the stability of the promises of the covenant
of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The saints’ perseverance in grace may be farther proved
from their inseparable union with Christ: this union is not only
federal, as he is the head of the covenant of grace, and they
his members, whose salvation he has engaged to bring about, as
was observed under the last head; but he may be considered
also as their vital head, from whom they receive spiritual life
and influence; so that as long as they abide in him, their spiritual
life is maintained as derived from him: if we consider
the church, or the whole election of grace as united to him, it
is called, <i>His body</i>, Col. i. 24. <i>the fulness of him that filleth all
in all</i>, Eph. i. 23. and every believer being a member of this
body, or a part, if I may so express it, of this fulness, if it
should perish and be separated from him, his body would be
defective, and he would sustain a loss of that which is an ingredient
in his fulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as this union includes in it that relation between
Christ and his people, which is, by a metaphorical way of speaking,
styled conjugal;<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> and accordingly is mutual, as the result
of his becoming theirs by an act of grace, and they his by an act
of self-dedication; this is the foundation of mutual love, which
is abiding, it is certainly so on his part; because it is unchangeable,
as founded on a covenant-engagement, which he cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>violate; and though their love to him be in itself subject to
change, through the prevalency of corrupt nature, which too
much inclines them to be unstedfast in this marriage-covenant;
yet he will recover and bring them back to him, and will not
deal with them as persons do with strangers, whom they exclude
from their presence or favour, if they render themselves
unworthy of it; but they who stand in a nearer relation to him,
and accordingly are the objects of his special love, shall not be
cast off for ever, how much soever he may resent their unworthy
behaviour to him. Not to be separate from Christ, is, according
to the apostle’s expression, not to <i>be separated</i> from
his love; and this, he says, he was <i>persuaded</i> that he should
not be, or <i>that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to do it</i>,
Rom. viii. 35, 38, 39. Accordingly it is said, that <i>having loved
his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto the end</i>,
John xiii. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I cannot but take notice of a very jejune and empty
sense which some give of this text, to evade the force of the
argument taken from it, to prove the doctrine we are maintaining.
How plausible soever it may seem to be to those who
conclude that this must be the true sense, because it favours
their own cause: by <i>his own</i> they mean no other than Christ’s
disciples, whom he was at that time conversant with; and indeed,
they apply whatever Christ says, in some following chapters,
to them, exclusive of all others; as when he says, <i>Ye are
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world</i>, chap.
xv. 19. and <i>because I live, ye shall live also</i>, chap. xiv. 19.
This, they suppose, respects them in particular; and so in the
text before us, <i>having loved his own which were in the world</i>;
that is, his own disciples; as though he had a propriety in none
but them; <i>he loved them to the end</i>; that is, not to the end of
their lives; for that would prove the doctrine we are maintaining,
but to the end of his life, which was now at hand; and
his love to them, they suppose to be expressed in this, that he
condescended to wash their feet. But if this were the sense of
the words, his love to them would not be so extraordinary a
privilege as it really is; for it would be only an instance of
human and not divine love. And indeed, our happiness consists,
not only in Christ’s loving us to the end of his life; but
in his continuing to express his love in his going into heaven
to prepare a place, and there making continual intercession for
us; and in the end, in his coming again to receive us to himself,
that where he is, we may be also; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. That the saints’ perseverance farther appears from Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>continual intercession for them. This has been particularly explained
in a foregoing answer;<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a> and the apostle speaking of
his <i>ever living to make intercession</i> for his people, infers that
<i>he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
him</i>, Heb. vii. 25. This he could not be said to do, should he
leave the work which he has begun in them, imperfect, and
suffer them, who come to him by faith, to apostatize from him.
We have before considered Christ’s intercession, as including
in it his appearing in the presence of God, in the behalf of
those for whom he offered himself a sacrifice while here on
earth; and also, that what he intercedes for shall certainly be
granted him, not only because he is the Son of God, in whom
he is well pleased, but because he pleads his own merits; and
to deny to grant what he merited, would be, in effect, to deny
the sufficiency thereof, as though the purchase had not been
fully satisfactory; therefore we must conclude, as he himself
said on earth, that <i>the Father heareth him always</i>. It is also
evident, that he prays for the perseverance of his people, as he
says to Peter, <i>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not</i>,
Luke xxii. 32. And there are many things in that affectionate
prayer, mentioned in John xvii. which he put up to God, immediately
before his last sufferings, which respect their perseverance
in grace; as when he says, <i>Holy Father, keep through
thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may
be one, as we are</i>, John xvii. 11. and, <i>I pray not that thou
shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep
them from the evil</i>, ver. 15. that is, either the evil that often
attends the condition in which they are, in the world, that so
the work of grace may not suffer, at least, not miscarry thereby;
or else, that he would keep them from the evil one, that
so they may not be brought again under his dominion; he also
prays, <i>that they may be made perfect in one</i>, ver. 23. that is,
not only that they may be perfectly joined together in the same
design, but that this unanimity may continue till they are
brought to a state of perfection; and <i>that the world may know
that God has loved them, even as he has loved Christ</i>. And he
declares his <i>will</i>; which shews that his intercession is founded
on justice, and accordingly contains in it the nature of a demand,
rather than a supplication for what might be given or
denied, namely, <i>That they whom the Father had given him
might be with him where he is, that they may behold his glory</i>,
ver. 24. all which expressions are very inconsistent with the
supposition, that it is possible that they, whom he thus intercedes
for, may apostatize, or fall short of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected by some, that this prayer respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>none but his disciples, who were his immediate friends and followers,
and not believers in all ages and places in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> But to this it may be replied, That the contrary hereunto
is evident, from several things which are mentioned in
this prayer, as for instance, he says, That <i>the Father had given
him power over all flesh; that he should give eternal life to as
many as he had given him</i>, ver. 2. the sense of which words
will sink too low, if we suppose that he intends thereby, thou
hast given me power to dispose of all persons and things in
this world, that I may give eternal life to that small number
which thou hast given me, namely, my disciples; whereas he
speaks of that universal dominion which he has over all persons
and things, which were committed to him with this view,
that all those who were put into his hand to redeem and save,
should attain eternal life: and again, he says, <i>I have manifested
thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world;
thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept
thy word</i>, ver. 6. Did Christ manifest the divine name and
glory to none but those who were his disciples; and were there
none but them that had kept his word? And when he says,
that they whom he prayed for, are the Father’s; and adds,
that <i>all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
in them</i>, ver. 9, 10. Is the number of those, whom Christ has
a right to, and the Father has set apart for himself, in whom
he would shew forth his glory, as the objects of his love, and
in whom Christ, as Mediator, was to be glorified, so small, as
that it contained only the eleven disciples? Or does it not rather
respect all that have, or shall believe, from the beginning
to the end of time? and when he speaks of <i>the world’s hating
them, because they are not of the world</i>, John xvii. 14, 15. and
of their being exposed to the evils that are in the world, or the
assaults of Satan, who is their avowed enemy; is this only applicable
to the disciples? And when he says, <i>Neither pray I
for these alone</i>, that is, for those who now believe, <i>but for them
also which shall believe</i>, ver. 20. does it not plainly intimate that
he had others in view besides his disciples? These, and several
other passages in this prayer, are a sufficient evidence that
there is no weight in the objection, to overthrow the argument
we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Believers’ perseverance in grace may be proved from the
Spirit and seed of God abiding in them. When at first they
were regenerated, it was by the power of the Holy Ghost, as
condescending to come and take up his abode in them: thus
we read of their being acted by, and under the influence of,
the Holy Ghost, who is said to dwell where he is pleased to
display his divine power and glory; and if these displays hereof
be internal, then he dwells in the heart. Our Saviour speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of him, as <i>another Comforter</i> given, <i>that he may abide</i> with his
people <i>for ever</i>, chap. xiv. 19. And this indwelling of the Spirit
is very distinct from that extraordinary dispensation which
the church had, when they were favoured with inspiration; for
the apostle speaks of it as a privilege peculiar to believers as
such, when he says, <i>Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit;
if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you: Now if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his</i>, Rom. viii. 9. the
meaning of which cannot be, that they have no interest in
Christ, who have not the extraordinary <i>afflatus</i> of the Spirit,
such as the prophets had; therefore we must suppose, that this
is a privilege which believers have in all ages. Now if the Spirit
is pleased to condescend thus to take up his abode in the
soul, and that for ever, he will certainly preserve it from
apostacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that there are several fruits and
effects of the Spirit’s dwelling in the soul, which affords an additional
proof of this doctrine: thus believers are said to have
<i>the first fruits of the Spirit</i>, ver. 23. that is, they have those
graces wrought in them which are the beginning of salvation;
and as the first fruits are a part of the harvest that will follow,
these are the fore-tastes of the heavenly blessedness which God
would never have bestowed upon them had he not designed
to preserve them from apostasy. Moreover, believers are said
to be <i>sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
of their inheritance</i>, Eph. i. 13, 14. The earnest, as given
by men, is generally deemed a part of payment, upon which
they who are made partakers thereof, are satisfied that they
shall, at last, receive the full reward; and shall believers miss
of the heavenly blessedness, who have such a glorious pledge
and earnest of it? Again, if we consider <i>the Spirit as bearing
witness with their spirits, that they are the children of God; and
if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ</i>;
and that <i>they shall be glorified together</i> with him, Rom. viii.
16, 17. is this testimony invalid, or not to be depended on,
which it could not be were it possible for them to fall from a
state of grace?</p>

<p class='c006'>This testimony is what we depend very much upon, in order
to our attaining assurance that we are in a state of grace, and
shall persevere therein, as will be observed under the next answer;
therefore we shall at present, take it for granted, that
there is such a thing as assurance, or that this blessing is attainable;
and the use which I would make of this supposition
to maintain our present argument, is, that if the Spirit has an
hand in working or encouraging this hope that we have of the
truth of grace, and consequently shall persevere therein to salvation,
this argues that it is warrantable, and not delusive; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>he that is the author or giver of it cannot deceive our expectation,
or put us upon looking for that which is not a reality.
From whence it follows, that it is impossible that they should
apostatize, to whom <i>God has given</i> this <i>good hope through
grace</i>, so that they should fail of that <i>everlasting consolation</i>,
which is connected with it, 2 Thess. ii. 16. This consequence
will hardly be denied by those who are on the other side of
the question; and we may observe, that they who oppose the
doctrine of perseverance, always deny that of assurance, especially
as proceeding from the testimony of the Spirit: nevertheless,
that we may not be misunderstood, we do not say, that
every one who has a strong persuasion that he shall be saved,
shall be saved; which is no other than enthusiasm; but our
argument is, in short, this, that if there be a witness of the Spirit
to this truth, that cannot be charged therewith, then the doctrine
we are maintaining, is undeniably true, which will more
evidently appear from what will be said in defence of the doctrine
of assurance under our next answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>And therefore we proceed to the other branch of the argument
before-mentioned, to prove this doctrine, namely, that
believers have the seed of God abiding in them; which is
founded on what the apostle says in 1 John iii. 9. <i>Whosoever
is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed abideth in him,
and he cannot sin because he is born of God</i>; for the understanding
of which let us consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That by the words, <i>he cannot commit sin</i>, the apostle
does not intend that such an one is not a sinner, or that there
is such a thing as sinless perfection attainable in this life; for
that is contrary, not only to the whole tenor of scripture, and
daily experience of mankind; but to what he had expressly
said, <i>If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us</i>, 1 John i. 8. Therefore, in this text, upon
which our present argument is founded, he is, doubtless, speaking
of persons committing sins, inconsistent with the truth of
grace, as he says in a foregoing verse, <i>Whosoever sinneth hath
not seen him, neither known him</i>, chap. iii. 6. it is such a sin
therefore as argues a person to be in a state of unregeneracy;
and then, <i>He that committeth sin is of the devil</i>, ver. 8. therefore
he certainly speaks of such a commission of sin, as argues
us to be under the reigning power of the devil: and that this
may plainly appear to be his sense, we may observe, that he
elsewhere distinguishes between <i>a sin that is unto death</i>, and a
sin that is <i>not unto death</i>, chap. v. 16, 17. by which he does not
mean, as the Papists suppose, that some sins deserve eternal
death, and others not; the former of which they call mortal
sins; the latter venial; but he is speaking of a sin that is inconsistent
with the principle of grace, and that which is consistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>therewith; the former is sometimes called <i>the pollution that is
in the world, through lust</i>, 2 Pet. i. 4. the latter <i>the spot of God’s
children</i>, Deut. xxxii. 5. The least sin deserves death, though
they who commit it shall not perish, but be brought to repentance;
but the <i>sin unto death</i> is wilful sin, committed and continued
in with impenitency; and with this limitation we are
to understand the apostle’s words, <i>He who is born of God doth
not commit sin</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We shall now consider the reason assigned, why the
person he speaks of, cannot, in this sense, commit sin; namely,
because he is <i>born of God</i>, and <i>the seed of God abideth, in
him</i>. To be born of God, is what is elsewhere styled regeneration,
or being born of the Spirit, in which there is a principle
of grace implanted, which is here called <i>the seed of God</i>. And,
indeed, this metaphorical way of speaking is very expressive
of the thing designed hereby; for as in nature the seed produces
fruit, and in things moral, the principle of action produces
action, as the principle of reason produces acts of reason: so in
things spiritual, the principle of grace produces acts of grace;
and this principle being from God, which has been largely
proved under a foregoing answer,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> it is called here, <i>the seed
of God</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) This seed of God, or this principle is not barely said
to be in the believer, as that which, for the present, is the
ground of spiritual actions; but it is said to <i>remain in him</i>.
As elsewhere Christ speaks of the Spirit as <i>abiding</i> with his
people <i>for ever</i>, John xiv. 16. so here the apostle speaks of
that principle of grace wrought by the Spirit, as abiding, that
is, continuing for ever; and from thence he infers, that a believer
<i>cannot sin</i>; for if he had been only speaking of its being
implanted, but not abiding; all that could be inferred from
thence would be, that he does not sin; but whereas, he argues
from it, that he cannot sin, that is, apostatize; it being understood,
that this principle abides in him continually; which plainly
contains the sense of the argument we are maintaining,
namely, that because the seed of God abides in a believer,
therefore he cannot apostatize, or fall short of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>They who are on the other side of the question, seem to find
it very difficult to evade the force of this argument: some suppose
that the apostle intends no more but that he that is born of
God, should not commit sin; but that is not only remote from
the sense of the words <i>cannot sin</i>;<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a> but it does not sufficiently
distinguish one that is born of God, from another that is not so;
for it is as much a truth, that an unregenerate person ought not
to sin, as when we speak of one that is regenerate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others, by not sinning, suppose that the apostle means, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>sin with difficulty, or they are hardly brought to commit sin;
but as this also does not answer to the sense of the word <i>cannot</i>
sin, so it is inconsistent with that beautiful gradation, which
we may observe in the words. To say that he does not sin;
and then if he commits sin, it is with some difficulty, is not so
agreeable to that climax, which the apostle makes use of, when
he says, he does not commit sin, yea, he cannot.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others suppose that the apostle’s meaning is, that he that is
born of God, cannot sin unto death, or apostatize, so as to fall
short of salvation, so long as he makes a right use of this principle
of grace, which is implanted in him; but by opposing and
afterwards extinguishing it, he may become an apostate. But
we may observe; in answer to this, that the apostle does not
attribute his perseverance in grace, to his making use of the
principle, but his having it, or its abiding in him; and he sufficiently
fences against the supposition of its being possible that
the principle of grace may be wholly lost; for then this seed
could not be said to abide in him, nor would the inference deduced
from its abiding in him, namely, that he cannot sin, be
just.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, concerning this latter branch of the argument to prove
the saints’ perseverance in grace, taken from the seed of God,
abiding in believers: But there is one thing must be observed
before I dismiss this head, <i>viz.</i> That the principle of grace,
which is signified by this metaphor, though it be, and abide in
a believer; yet it does not always exert itself so as to produce
those acts of grace which would otherwise proceed from it.
This cannot be better illustrated than by a similitude taken from
the soul, which is the principle of reason in man; though it be
as much so in an infant in the womb as it is in any, yet it is altogether
unactive; for most allow that such have not the exercise
of thought or acts of reason; and when a person is newly
born, it hardly appears that this principle is deduced into act;
and in those in whom it has been deduced into act, it may be
rendered stupid, and almost unactive, or at least, so disordered,
that the actions which proceed from it cannot be styled rational,
through the influence of some bodily disease, with which
it is affected, yet still it remains a principle of reason. The
same may be said concerning the principle of grace; it is certainly
an unactive principle in those who are regenerate from
the womb; and it may cease to exert itself, and be with equal
reason, styled an unactive principle in believers, when they fall
into very great sins, to which it offers no resistance: This we
shall take occasion to apply under a following head, when we
shall consider some objections that are brought against this
doctrine, by those who suppose that believers, when sinning
presumptuously, as David, Peter, and others, are said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>done, fail totally, though not finally. There was indeed a total
suspension of the activity of this principle, but yet the principle
itself was not wholly lost; but more of this in its proper
place. We are therefore bound to conclude, that because this
principle abides in them, they can neither totally nor finally
apostatize, and therefore, that they can neither fall from a state
of grace, nor fail, at last, of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have endeavoured to explain and shew the force
of those arguments which are contained in this answer to prove
the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance. There are several
others that might have been insisted on; and particularly it
may be proved, from the end and design of Christ’s death,
which was not only that he might purchase to himself a peculiar
people, but that he might purchase eternal life for them;
and we cannot think that this invaluable price would have been
given for the procuring of that which should not be applied, in
which respect Christ would be said to die in vain. When a
person gives a price for any thing, it is with this design, that
he or they, for whom he purchased it, should be put into the
possession of it; which, if it be not done, the price that was
given is reckoned lost, and the person that gave it disappointed
hereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this argument may be considered as having still more
weight in it, if we observe, that the salvation of those whom
Christ has redeemed, not only redounds to their happiness, but
to the glory of God the Father, and of Christ, our great Redeemer.
God the Father, in giving Christ to be a propitiation
for sin, designed to bring more glory to his name than by all
his other works: Thus our Saviour appeals to him in the close
of his life, <i>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the
work which thou gavest me to do</i>, John xvii. 14. The work
was his, and there was a revenue of glory which he expected
thereby; and this glory did not only consist in his receiving a
full satisfaction for sin, that so he might take occasion to advance
his grace in forgiving it; but he is said to be glorified,
when his people are enabled to <i>bear much fruit</i>, chap. xv. 8.
Therefore the glory of God the Father is advanced by the application
of redemption, and consequently by bringing his redeemed
ones to perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Son is also glorified, not barely by his having those
honours, which his human nature is advanced to, as the consequence
of his finishing the work of redemption, but by the
application thereof to his people; accordingly he is said to be
<i>glorified in them</i>, chap. xviii. 10. that is, his mediatorial glory
is rendered illustrious by all the grace that is conferred upon
them; and therefore, certainly he will be eminently glorified,
when they are brought to be with him, where he is, to behold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>his glory. Now can we suppose, that since the Father and the
Son designed to have so great a glory redound to them by the
work of our redemption, that they will sustain any loss thereof,
for want of the application of it to them, for whom it was purchased.
If God designed, as the consequence thereof, that the
saints should sing that new song, <i>Thou art worthy, for thou
wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every
kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation</i>: And if God the
Father, and the Son, are both joined together, and their glory
celebrated therein, by their ascribing <i>blessing, glory, and power,
unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for
ever and ever</i>, Rev. v. 19. compared with 13. Then certainly
they will not lose this glory; and therefore, the saints shall be
brought into that state where they shall have occasion thus to
praise and adore them for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be objected to this, that God, the Father and the Son,
will be glorified, though many of his saints should apostatize,
and the death of Christ be, to no purpose, with respect to them,
because all shall not apostatize. The answer to this is plain
and easy; that though he could not be said to lose the glory
he designed, by the salvation of those who persevere, yet some
branches of his glory would be lost, by reason of the apostacy
of others, who fall short of salvation; and it is a dishonour to
him to suppose that he will lose the least branch thereof, or that
any of those, for whom Christ died, should be for ever lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also add, that for the same reason that we suppose
one whom Christ has redeemed, should be lost, all might
be lost, and so he would lose all the glory he designed to have
in the work of redemption. This appears, in that all are liable
to those temptations, which, if complied with, have a tendency
to ruin them. All are supposed to be renewed and sanctified
but in part, and consequently the work of grace meets with
those obstructions from corrupt nature; which would certainly
prove too hard for all our strength, and baffle our utmost endeavours
to persevere, did not God appear in our behalf, and
keep us by his power. Now, if all need strength from him to
stand, and must say, that without him they can do nothing,
then we must either suppose, that that grace is given to all
saints which shall enable them to persevere, or else that it is
given to none; if it be given to none, but all are left to themselves,
then that which overthrows the faith of one, would overthrow
the faith of all; and consequently we might conclude,
that whatever God the Father, or the Son have done, in order
to the redemption and salvation of the elect might be of none
effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might produce many other arguments in defence of the
saints’ perseverance, but shall conclude this head with two or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>three scriptures, whereby the truth hereof will farther appear:
Thus our Saviour says to the woman of Samaria, <i>Whosoever
drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst;
but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of
water springing up into everlasting life</i>, John iv. 14. Where,
by the water that Christ gives, is doubtless understood the gifts
and graces of the Spirit; these are not like the waters of a
brook, that often deceive the expectation of the traveller; but
they are a well of water, intimating that a believer shall have
a constant supply of grace and peace till he is brought to the
rivers of pleasure, which are at God’s right-hand, and is made
partaker of eternal life. Again, our Saviour says, <i>He that
heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting
life</i>, chap. v. 24. <i>i. e.</i> it is as surely his as though he
was in the actual possession of it; and he farther intimates,
that such are not only justified for the present; but they shall
not come into condemnation; certainly this implies that their
salvation is so secure as that it is impossible for them to perish
eternally.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another scripture that plainly proves this doctrine, is in 2
Tim. ii. 19. <i>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure,
having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his; and let
every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity</i>;
in which words the apostle encourages the church to hope for
perseverance in grace, after they had had a sad instance of two
persons of note, <i>viz.</i> Hymeneus and Philetus, who had not
only <i>erred from the truth</i>, but <i>overthrown the faith of some</i>;
and he cautions every one, who makes a profession of religion,
as they would be kept from apostatizing, to depart from iniquity,
<i>q. d.</i> since many of you are ready to fear that your faith
shall be overthrown, as well as that of others, by the sophistry
or cunning arts of those apostates who lie in wait to deceive,
you may be assured that their state is safe, who are built upon
that foundation which God has laid, that <i>chief corner stone,
elect, precious</i>, viz. Christ, <i>on whom he that believeth, shall not
be confounded</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 6. or else, that the instability of human
conduct shall not render it a matter of uncertainty, whether
they, who are ordained to eternal life, shall be saved or no;
for that depends on God’s purpose, relating hereunto, which is
a sure foundation, and has this seal annexed to it, whereby our
faith herein may be confirmed, that they whom God has set
apart for himself, and lays a special claim to, as his chosen and
redeemed ones, whom he has foreknown and loved with an everlasting
love, shall not perish eternally, because the purpose
of God cannot be frustrated. But inasmuch as there is no special
revelation given to particular persons, that they are the objects
of this purpose cf grace; therefore every one that names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>or professes the name of Christ ought to use the utmost caution,
that they be not ensnared; let them depart from all iniquity,
and not converse with those who endeavour to overthrow
their faith. And, indeed, all that are faithful shall be kept
from iniquity by God, as they are here given to understand
that it is their duty to endeavour to depart from it, and consequently
they shall be kept from apostacy. This seems to be
the sense of these words; and it is agreeable to the analogy of
faith, as well as a plain proof of the doctrine which we are
maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>A late writer<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a>, by <i>the foundation of God, which standeth
sure</i>, supposes the doctrine of <i>the resurrection</i> is intended,
which Hymeneus and Philetus denied, saying, that it <i>was past
already</i>; this doctrine, says he, which is a fundamental article
of faith, <i>standeth sure, having this seal the Lord knoweth them
that are his</i>; that is, he loveth and approveth of them. But
though it be true the resurrection is spoken of in the foregoing
verse, and we do not deny that it is a fundamental article of
faith; yet that does not seem to be the meaning of the word <i>foundation</i>,
in this text. For if by the resurrection we understand
the doctrine of the general resurrection of the dead, I cannot
see where the force of the apostle’s argument lies, <i>viz.</i> that
there shall be a general resurrection, because the Lord knoweth
who are his, since the whole world are to be raised from
the dead. But if by the resurrection we are to understand a
resurrection to eternal life, so that they who are known or beloved
of God, shall have their part in it, and the apostle’s method
of reasoning be this, that they who believe shall be raised
to eternal life; that is, so far from militating against the argument
we are maintaining, that it is agreeable to the sense we
have given of the text, and makes for, rather than against us.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is farther advanced by the author but now mentioned,
<i>viz.</i> that <i>the Lord knoweth who are his</i>, is to be taken for
that regard which God had to his apostles and ministers. This
seems too great a strain on the sense of the words, and so
much different from the scope of the apostle therein, as well as
disagreeable to the caution given, that <i>every one who names the
name of Christ</i> should <i>depart from iniquity</i>, that no one who
reads the scriptures without prejudice, can easily give into this
sense of the text.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall mention but one scripture more for the proof of this
doctrine, and that is in 1 John ii. 19. <i>They went out from us,
but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would,
no doubt, have continued with us; but they went out, that they
might be made manifest that they were not all of us</i>; for the understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of which, let it be considered, that the apostle is
speaking of some who were formerly members of the church,
who afterwards turned apostates and open enemies to Christ,
and his gospel: It is plain that the words <i>they went out from us</i>,
and <i>they were not of us</i>, must be taken in different respects,
otherwise it would imply a contradiction, to say that a person
departed from the faith and communion of the church, when he
never embraced it, or had communion with it; but if they understand
it thus, they left the faith and communion of the
church because they were Christians only in pretence, and did
not heartily embrace the faith on which the church was built;
nor were they really made partakers of that grace, which the
apostles, and other faithful members of the church, had received
from God, as being effectually called thereby, the sense is
very plain and easy, <i>viz.</i> That there were some false professors,
who made a great shew of religion, and were admitted into
communion with the church, and, it may be, some of them
preached the gospel, and were more esteemed than others;
but they apostatized; for they had not the truth of grace, but
were like the seed that sprang up without having root in itself,
which afterwards withered; whereas, if they had had this grace
it would have been abiding, and so they would, <i>without doubt</i>,
says the apostle, <i>have continued with us</i>; but by their apostacy
it appears, that they were not, in this sense, of our number,
that is believers.</p>

<p class='c006'>They who understand this scripture, not of persons who were
members of the church, but ministers, that first joined themselves
with the apostles, and afterwards deserted them, and
their doctrine, advance nothing that tends to overthrow the argument
we are maintaining; for we may then understand
the words thus, they pretended to be the true ministers of
Jesus Christ, and doubtless, to be, as the apostles were, men
of piety and religion, for, in other respects, they were of them
visibly, whilst they preached the same doctrines; but afterwards,
by departing from the faith, it appeared, that though
they were ministers they were not sincere Christians, for if
they had, they would not have apostatized.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall now proceed to consider the objections that
are usually brought against the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance
in grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 1. It is objected, that there are several persons mentioned
in scripture, who appear to have been true believers,
and yet apostatized, some totally, as David and Peter; others
not only totally, but finally, in which number Solomon is included;
and others are described as apostates, such as Hymeneus
and Alexander, who are said <i>concerning faith, to have
made shipwreck</i>, and therefore it is supposed that they had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>grace of faith; and Judas is also, by them, reckoned to have
been a true believer, whom all allow afterwards to have proved
an apostate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> 1. As to the case of David and Peter, it is true, their
fall was very notorious, and the former seems to have continued
some months in a state of impenitency; and when they fell,
there appeared no marks of grace in either of them. Peter’s
sin, indeed, was committed through surprize and fear; but yet
it had such aggravating circumstances attending it, that if
others, whose character is less established than his was, had
committed the same sin, we should be ready to conclude, that
they were in a state of unregeneracy; and David’s sin was committed
with that deliberation, and was so complicated a crime,
that if any believer ever lost the principle of grace, we should
have been inclined to suppose this to have been his case. Nevertheless,
that which gives us ground to conclude that this
principle was not wholly extinguished, either in Peter or him,
at the same time that they fell; and therefore, that they were
not total apostates, is what we before observed, that the principle
of grace may be altogether unactive, and yet abide in the
soul, agreeably to the sense we gave of that scripture, <i>his seed
abideth in him</i>; and if what has been already said concerning
the possibility of the principle of grace remaining, though it
makes no resistance against the contrary habits of sin, be of any
force,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> then these and other instances of the like nature, on
which one branch of the objection is founded, will not be sufficient
to prove the possibility of the total apostacy of any true
believer.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As to the case of Solomon; that he once was a true believer
is allowed on both sides; for it is said concerning him,
soon after he was born, that <i>the Lord loved him</i>, 2 Sam. xii.
24, 25. upon which occasion he gave him that significant name,
Jedidiah, the beloved of the Lord; and it is certain, that in the
beginning of his reign, his piety was no less remarkable than
his wisdom, as appears from his great zeal, expressed in building
the temple of God, and establishing the worship thereof;
and also from that extraordinary instance of devotion with
which he dedicated or consecrated the house to God, 1 Kings
viii. 1. &amp; <i>seq.</i> and the prayer put up to him on that occasion,
and also from God’s appearing to him twice: in his first appearance
he condescended to ask him, what he would give
him? and upon Solomon’s choosing, <i>an understanding heart</i>,
to judge his people, he was pleased with him, and gave him
several other things that he asked not for; so that there were
<i>not any among the kings like unto him</i>, chap. iii. 5, 9, 10, 12,
13. from all this it is taken for granted, that he once was a believer:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>but, on the other hand, we must, if we duly weigh the
force of the objection, set the latter part of his life against the
former, in which we find him guilty of very great sins; not
only in multiplying wives and concubines, beyond what any of
his predecessors had done, but in that <i>his heart was turned
away after other gods, and</i>, as it is expressly said, <i>was not perfect
with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, his father</i>,
chap. xi. 4. And it is also said, that <i>the Lord was angry
with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God
of Israel, which had appeared to him twice</i>, ver. 9. and on this
occasion he determined to rend part of the kingdom from his
son, ver. 13. which came to pass accordingly; and all this is
said to have been done <i>when he was old</i>, ver. 4. And after this
we read of several that were <i>stirred up as adversaries</i> to him,
ver. 14, 23, 26. And in the remaining part of his history we
read of little but trouble and uneasiness that he met with; and
this seemed to continue till his death, of which we have an
account in 1 Kings xi. chapter throughout, which contains the
history of his sin, and troubles; and we read not the least word
of his repentance therein; for which reason he is supposed, in
the objection, to have apostatized totally and finally.</p>

<p class='c006'>The main strength of this objection lies in the supposition,
that Solomon did not repent of his idolatry which he committed
in his old age, or, as it is supposed, in the latter part of his life,
and also from the silence of scripture as to the matter; especially
in that part of it which gives an account of his fall and
death. But this is not sufficient to support the weight of the
objection, and to oblige us to conclude him to be an apostate;
for there is nothing that appears from the account we have of
him in scripture, but that he might have sufficient time for repentance
between his fall and death. It is said indeed, that in
his old age his wives turned him aside, but this they might do,
and yet he not die an apostate; for sometimes that part of life
which is called old age, comprises in it several years; therefore,
when he began to be in his declining age, he might sin,
and after that be brought to repentance. And as for the scripture’s
speaking first of his fall, and then of his death; it does
not follow from thence that one was immediately after the
other; since the history of the blemishes and troubles of his
life is but short.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, there are several things which may give
us ground to conclude, that he repented after his fall; particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We have an intimation hereof in God’s promise relating
thereunto, in which it is supposed, that God would suffer
him to fall, and a provisionary encouragement is given to
expect that he should be recovered: thus he says, <i>I will chastise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children
of men; but my mercy shall not depart away from him,
as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee</i>, 1 Sam.
vii. 14, 15. and the same thing is repeated, in which his fall
is supposed, and his recovery from it particularly mentioned,
in Psal. lxxxix. 30-34. as though God had designed that this
should be a supplement to his history, and remove the doubts
which might arise from it, with relation to his salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are some things in other parts of scripture, which
give sufficient ground to conclude, that he was a true penitent,
which plainly refer to that part of his life which was between
his fall and his death. Thus, if we duly weigh several passages
in Ecclesiastes, which none can deny that he was the inspired
writer of, inasmuch as it is said, in the title or preface
set before it, that they are <i>the words of the preacher, the son of
David, king of Jerusalem</i>, we shall find many things in which
he expresses the great sense of the vanity of his past life, when
he says, <i>I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness
and folly</i>, Eccl. i. 17. where, by <i>madness and folly</i>, he
doubtless intends that which was so in a moral sense, when he
indulged his sinful passions, which respects the worst part of
his life. And this he farther insists on; <i>Whatsoever mine eyes
desired, I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any
joy, for my heart rejoiced in all my labour</i>, Eccl. ii. 10. or in
all things, which afterwards were matter of grief and uneasiness
to me; in which he observes how he did, as it were, take
pains to bring on himself a long train of miseries that troubled
him afterwards; and then he plainly expresses his repentance,
when he says, <i>All was vanity and vexation of spirit</i>, and there
was <i>no profit under the sun</i>, ver. 11. as though he should say,
I turned from God to the creature, to see what happiness I
could find therein, but met with nothing but disappointment;
he had no profit in those things, whereof he was now ashamed.
It is probable, God shewed him the vanity thereof, by his chastening
him, or visiting his transgressions with the rod, and his
iniquities with stripes, as he had promised to do; and this ended
in vexation of spirit, which is a plain intimation of that godly
sorrow that proceeded from a sense of sin, which made him,
beyond measure, uneasy; and this vexation or uneasiness was
so great, that he says, <i>I hated life</i>, that is, I hated my past
wicked life, and abhorred myself for it, <i>because the work that
is wrought under the sun, is grievous unto me</i>; that is, the work
that I have wrought, was such as gave me grief of heart; <i>for
all is vanity and vexation of spirit</i>, ver. 17. that is, this is all
the consequence thereof: it cannot be supposed that he was
weary of his life for the same reasons that many others are,
who are deprived of the blessings of common providence, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>reduced to that condition that makes them miserable, as to their
outward circumstances in the world; but it was the uneasiness
he found in his own spirit, the secret wounds of conscience and
bitterness of soul, which arose from a sense of sin, that made
him thus complain.</p>

<p class='c006'>And elsewhere, he seems to be sensible of his sin, in heaping
up vast treasures, which he calls <i>loving silver</i>; and adds, that
such an one, which seems very applicable to his own case, <i>shall
not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance, with
increase; this is also vanity</i>, chap. v. 10. that is, this had been
an instance of his former vanity: and he adds, <i>The sleep of a
labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the
abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep</i>, ver. 12. If
by this we understand that the increase of riches sometimes
gives disturbance to, and stirs up the corruptions of those that
possess them, and this be applied to himself, it is an acknowledgment
of his sin. Or, if we understand by it that the abundance
of a rich man will not give him rest at night, when his
mind is made uneasy with a sense of the guilt of sin, and this
be applied to his own case, when fallen by it; then it intimates
that his repentance gave him not only uneasiness by day, but
took away his rest by night; and it seems not improbable, that
what gave him farther occasion to see the vanity of his past
life, was the sense of mortality impressed on him; for he says,
<i>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house
of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will
lay it to his heart</i>, chap. vii. 3. that is, he will, or ought to improve
the sense of his own frailty, which we may conclude he
had done; and therefore adds, <i>Sorrow is better than laughter;
for by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better</i>,
ver. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if it be objected, that all these expressions are not applicable
to himself, and many others of the like nature, which
might have been referred to, which are expressive of his great
repentance; though I cannot but think that the contrary to this
seems very probable; yet there is something farther added,
that he expressly applies to himself, which refers to his unlawful
love of women: <i>I find more bitter than death the woman
whose heart is snares, and nets, and her hands as bands. Whoso
pleaseth God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken
by her: behold, this have I found, saith the preacher</i>, ver. 26,
27. If these things be not expressive of repentance, it is hard
to say what are.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that as he expresses a grief of heart
for past sins; so he warns others that they may not be guilty of
that which he himself found more bitter than death; and accordingly,
having described the arts used by the wicked woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to betray the unthinking passenger, he cautions every one
to take heed of declining to her ways; inasmuch as the consequence
thereof will be, that a <i>dart</i> will <i>strike through his
liver</i>, and he is <i>as a bird that hasteth to the snare, and knoweth
not that it is for his life</i>, Prov. vii. 23. compared with the foregoing
verses. He also adds, That <i>she hath cast down many
wounded; yea, many strong men have been slain by her. Her
house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death</i>,
ver. 26, 27. So that we find in Solomon, two of the greatest
evidences that we can have of sincere repentance; namely, a
great degree of sorrow for sin, and an earnest desire that others
would avoid it, by giving those cautions that are necessary to
prevent their falling into the snare in which he had been entangled.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) There is something spoken in Solomon’s commendation,
after his death, which may be gathered from what is said,
that during the three first years of Rehoboam’s reign, which
God approved of he <i>walked in the way of David and Solomon</i>,
2 Chron. xi. 17. where we may observe, that Solomon is joined
with his father David: so that as there were abatements to be
made for the blemishes in David’s reign; the reign of Solomon
had in it great blemishes: but as one repented, so did the
other, and therefore ought not to be reckoned an apostate.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to all this we may add, that he was a penman of scripture;
and it does not appear that God conferred this honour
upon any that apostatized from him; but on the other hand,
they have this general character given of them by the apostle
Peter, that they were all <i>holy men of God</i>, 2 Pet. i. 21. which
we must conclude Solomon to have been, till we have greater
evidence to the contrary than they can produce who deny it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. There are others mentioned in the objection, to wit, Hymeneus
and Alexander, whose apostacy we have no ground to
doubt of; but we cannot allow that they fell from, or lost the
saving grace of faith. It is one thing to fall from the profession
of faith, and another thing to lose the grace of faith; therefore,
the only thing to be proved in answer to this branch of
the objection, is, that these persons, who are described as apostates,
never had the truth of grace; or that they only fell from
that visible profession which they made thereof; whereby they
were reckoned to be, what in reality they were not, namely,
true believers. Now that this may appear, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>That the apostle speaks of them as having <i>departed from
the faith</i>, viz. the doctrines of the gospel; and that was attended
with blasphemy, for which they were <i>delivered unto
Satan</i>, which is a phrase used by the apostle here and elsewhere,
for persons being cut off from the communion of the
church; upon which occasion he advises Timothy <i>to hold faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and a good conscience, which some having put away, concerning
faith, have made shipwreck</i>, as these have done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the main force of the objection seems to lie in this,
that they who have made shipwreck of faith, were once true
believers; therefore, such may apostatize, and so fall short of
salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>To which it may be replied, that by <i>faith</i> here, is meant the
doctrines of the gospel, which are often styled <i>faith</i>: thus it
is said, that the apostle <i>preached the faith which once he destroyed</i>,
Gal. i. 23. and elsewhere, <i>before faith came</i>; that is,
before the gospel-dispensation began, and those doctrines were
preached that were to be published therein to the world, <i>we
were kept under the law</i>, chap. iii. 23. And again, <i>Received
ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith</i>,
ver. 2. that is, by hearing those doctrines that are contained in
the gospel. Therefore, that which he chargeth these apostates
with, is making shipwreck of faith, considered objectively:
they once, indeed, held the truth, but it was in unrighteousness;
they had right notions of the gospel, which they afterwards
lost: now the apostle advises Timothy not only to <i>hold
faith</i>, that is, to retain the doctrines of the gospel, as one who
had right sentiments of divine truths, but to hold it <i>with a good
conscience</i>; for I take that expression, <i>hold faith and a good
conscience</i>, to contain an <i>hendyadis</i>; and so it is the same as
though he should say, Be not content with an assent to the
truths of the gospel, but labour after a conscience void of offence
towards God, that thou mayst have the testimony thereof,
that thy knowledge of divine truth is practical and experimental,
and then thou art out of danger of making shipwreck
of faith, as these have done, who held it without a good conscience.
It is not said they made shipwreck of a good conscience;
for that they never have had; but <i>concerning faith</i>,
which they once professed, <i>they made shipwreck</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same thing may be said concerning Judas; he apostatized
from the faith, which he once made a very great profession of,
being not only one of Christ’s disciples, but sent forth
with the rest of them, to preach the gospel, and work miracles;
yet it is evident, that he had not the saving grace of
faith. For our Saviour, who knew the hearts of all men, was
not deceived in him (though others were) inasmuch as it is
said, <i>He knew from the beginning who they were that believed
not, and who should betray him</i>, John vi. 64. However, the
principal force of the objection lies in this, that Judas must
needs have been a believer, because he was given to Christ;
and our Saviour says, that <i>those who were given him were kept
by him, and none of them was lost but the son of perdition</i>, chap.
xvii. 12. His being styled <i>the son of perdition</i>, argues him an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>apostate; and his being <i>given to Christ</i> denotes that he was
once a true believer; therefore he fell totally and finally. In
answer to which,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Some conclude, that they who are said to <i>be given to
Christ</i>, are such as were appointed, by the providence of God,
to be his servants in the work of the ministry. Now it is said
concerning them, that they were given to Christ, to be employed
by him in this service; and that all of them were kept faithful,
except the son of perdition. If this be the sense of their
being given to him, it does not necessarily infer their being
made partakers of special grace: it is one thing to be given to
Christ, to be employed in some peculiar acts of service, in
which his glory is concerned; and another thing to be given to
him, as being chosen and called by him, to partake of special
communion with him: if Judas had been given to him in this
latter sense, he would not have been a son of perdition, but
would have been kept by him, as the other disciples were; but
inasmuch as he was only given to Christ, that he might serve
the design of his providence, in the work of the ministry, he
might be lost, or appear to be a son of perdition, and yet not
fall from the truth of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) If, by being <i>given to Christ</i>, we understand a being
given to him, as objects of his special love, we must suppose,
that all who were thus given to him, were kept by him; in
which sense Judas, who is called <i>the son of perdition</i>, and was
not kept by him, was not given to him: accordingly the particle
<i>but</i> is not exceptive, but adversative; and it is as though
he should say, <i>All that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of
them is lost; but the son of perdition is lost</i>, I have not preserved
him; for he was not the object of my special care and love;
he was not given me to save, therefore he is lost. Now it is
certain, that the particle <i>but</i> is used in this sense in many other
scriptures, particularly that wherein it is said, <i>There shall in
no wise enter into it</i>, that is, the heavenly Jerusalem, <i>any thing
that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh
a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life</i>,
Rev. xxi. 27. <i>q. d.</i> ungodly men shall not enter in; but they
that are written in the lamb’s book of life shall<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a>. Thus much
concerning this objection, taken from particular persons, who
are supposed to have fallen from grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. The next objection is taken from what the apostle
Paul says concerning the church of the Jews, whom he describes
as apostatized from God; and it is evident, that they
are, to this day, given up to judicial blindness, and not in the
least disposed to repent of that crime for which they were cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>off by him; concerning these he says, that they once were
holy; <i>If the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the
root be holy, so are the branches</i>, Rom. xi. 16. and afterwards
he speaks of <i>their casting away</i>, and <i>some of the branches being
broken off, because of unbelief</i>, ver. 15, 17, 19, 20. Now
if the whole church apostatized, we must conclude at least,
that some of them were true believers, and therefore true believers
may fall from the grace of God.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> That the church of the Jews apostatized, and were
cut off for their unbelief, is sufficiently evident: but we must
distinguish between the apostacy of a professing people, such
as the church of the Jews were, who first rejected God, and
then were cast off by him, and the apostacy of those who were
truly religious among them; the apostle himself gives us ground
for this distinction, when he says, <i>they are not all Israel which
are of Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abraham are
they all children</i>, chap. ix. 6, 7. And elsewhere he distinguishes
between one who is <i>a Jew</i>, as being partaker of the
external privileges of the covenant, which that church was under,
and a person’s being <i>a Jew</i>, as partaking of the saving
blessings thereof; as he says, <i>He is not a Jew which is one
outwardly, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in
the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision
is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter;
whose praise is not of men, but of God</i>, Rom. ii. 28, 29. A
church may lose its external privileges, and cease to have the
honourable character given it; the greatest part of them may
be blinded, when, at the same time <i>the election</i>, that is, all
among them who were chosen to eternal life, <i>obtained it</i>, as
the apostle observes, chap. xi. 7. and thereby intimates, that
some who were members of that church were faithful; those
were preserved from the common apostacy, being converted to
the Christian faith. Their privileges, as members of a church,
were lost, but they still retained their spiritual and inseparable
union with Christ, which they had as believers, and not as
the result of their being the natural seed of Abraham, they
were made partakers of the blessings that accompany salvation;
and therefore were not separated from the love of God
in Christ, whilst formal professors and hypocrites, who were
Abraham’s natural seed, but not his spiritual, were cast off by
Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 3. It is farther objected, that there are some who have
the character of righteous persons, concerning whom it is supposed,
that they may fall away or perish; particularly those
mentioned in Ezek. xviii. 24. <i>When the righteous man turneth
away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doth
according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be
mentioned, in the trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his
sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die</i>: And in Heb. x.
38. it is said, <i>The just shall live by faith; but if any man</i>, or,
as the word should be rendered, if <i>he draw back, my soul shall
have no pleasure in him</i>. Therefore, since the righteous man
may turn from his righteousness, and draw back to perdition,
the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance cannot be defended.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> 1. As to the former of these scriptures, we must consider
the sense thereof agreeably to the context, and the scope
and design of the prophet therein; he had often reproved them
for those vile abominations which they were guilty of, and had
denounced the threatnings of God, which should have their
accomplishment in their utter ruin; particularly, he fortels the
judgments that should sweep away many of them before, and
others that should befal them in the captivity: this is the subject
principally insisted on by the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel;
whereupon sometimes they were represented as disliking
the doctrine, desiring that <i>smooth things</i> might be prophesied
unto them, and <i>the holy one of Israel might cease from before
them</i>. At other times they are represented as complaining of
the hardship of this dispensation, intimating that it was unjust
and severe, and, at the same time, justifying themselves, as
though they had done nothing that deserved it; but all this
was to befal them for the sins of their fathers, and accordingly
there was a proverbial expression often made use of by them,
mentioned verse 2d of this chapter, <i>The fathers have eaten sour
grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge</i>; by which they
did not understand that we expect to perish eternally for our
fathers’ sins, in which sense it must be taken, if this objection
has any force in it: now God, by the prophet, tells them that
they had no reason to use this proverb, and so puts them upon
looking into their past conduct, and enquiring, whether they
had not been guilty of the same sins that their fathers were
charged with? which, if they could exculpate themselves from,
they should be delivered, and not die, that is, not fall by those
judgments which either should go before, or follow the captivity;
for that seems to be the sense of <i>dying</i>, according to
the prophetic way of speaking, as we have observed elsewhere.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
For the understanding of this scripture we must consider, that
the prophet addresses himself to <i>the house of Israel</i>, who are
represented, ver. 25. as complaining, that <i>the way of the Lord
was not equal</i>; or, that God’s threatnings or judgments, which
were the forerunners of the captivity, were such as they had
not deserved; and therefore he tells them that he would deal
with them according to their deserts, ver. 24. <i>When the righteous</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that is, one whose conversation before this seemed to be
unblemished, and he not guilty of those enormous crimes which
were committed by others (which may be supposed, and yet
the person not be in a state of grace) I say, when such an one
<i>turneth away from his righteousness, and doth according to all
the abominations that the wicked man doth</i>, that is, becomes
openly vile and profligate; <i>shall he live?</i> can he expect any
thing else but that God should follow him with exemplary
judgments, or that he should be involved in the common destruction?
<i>In his sin that he hath sinned shall he die.</i> And on
the other hand, ver. 27. <i>When the wicked man turneth away
from his wickedness</i>; that is, they who have been guilty of these
abominations shall reform their lives, or turn from their idolatry,
murders, adulteries, oppressions, and other vile crimes,
that the people in general were charged with, by the prophet,
which are assigned as the reason of God’s sending this dreadful
judgment of the captivity; I say, if there be such an instance
of reformation, <i>he shall save his soul alive</i>; that is, either
he shall be delivered from the captivity, or shall be preserved
from those temporal judgments that either went before
or followed after it. This reformation, and deliverance from
these judgments, includes in it something less than saving
grace, and a right to eternal life, which is inseparably connected
with it, so that if nothing else be intended by the <i>righteous</i>
and <i>wicked man</i>; and if the judgments threatened, or their
deliverance from them, in case of reformation, includes no
more than this, it is evident, that it does not in the least suppose,
that any true believer shall apostatize or fall from a state
of grace. As we may distinguish between eternal death and
temporal judgments; so we must distinguish between a person’s
abstaining from the vilest abominations, as a means to
escape these judgments; and his exercising those graces that
accompany salvation. There may be an external reformation
in those who have no special grace, if nothing farther be regarded
than a person’s moral character, or inoffensive behaviour
in the eye of the world. If we only consider him as abstaining
from those sins which are universally reckoned disreputable
among those who make any pretensions to religion,
and in this respect he be denominated a righteous man, such
an one may turn away from his righteousness and become immoral
and profligate, and so be reckoned among the number of
apostates: nevertheless he cannot be said to apostatize or fall
from the grace of God, since moral virtue or the exercise of
righteousness in our dealings with men is as much inferior to
saving grace, as a form of godliness is to the power thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As to the other scripture, mentioned in the objection, it is
generally urged against us as an unanswerable argument, taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>from the express words thereof, to prove the possibility of the
saints’ apostacy; and our translation is charged with a wilful
mistake, to serve a turn, and make the text speak what it
never intended, since all who understand the original must allow
that it ought to be rendered, <i>If he draw back</i>, which supposes
that the just man may apostatize, or draw back unto
perdition. To which it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That though the words, according to the form in which
they are laid down, contain a supposition, it does not infer the
being or reality of the thing supposed<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a>; but only this, that if
such a thing should happen, it would be attended with what is
laid down as a consequence thereof. This is very agreeable
to our common mode of speaking, as when we say; if a virtuous
person should commit a capital crime, he will fall under
the lash of the law as much as though he had made no pretensions
to virtue; nevertheless, it does not follow from hence,
that such an one shall do it, or expose himself to this punishment;
or, on the other hand, if a king should say to a criminal,
as Solomon did to Adonijah, ‘If he will shew himself a
worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth,’
it cannot be concluded from hence, that he will behave himself
so as that his life shall be secured to him. The proposition
is true, as there is a just connexion between the supposition
and the consequence; yet this does not argue that the
thing supposed shall come to pass. Now to apply this to the
scripture, under our present consideration; the proposition is
doubtless true, that if the just man should draw back, so as
to become a wicked man, if he should lose the principle of
grace which was implanted in regeneration, and abandon himself
to the greatest impieties, he would as certainly perish as
though he had never experienced the grace of God; but it
must not be inferred from hence, that God will suffer such an
one, who is the object both of his love and care, thus to fall
and perish, so that his soul should have no pleasure in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) If we suppose the person here spoken of, whom we consider
as a true believer, to draw back, we may distinguish between
backsliding or turning aside from God, by the commission
of very great sins; and apostacy. Or between drawing
back, by being guilty of great crimes, so as to expose himself
to sore judgments; and his drawing back to perdition. The
just man in this text, is said, indeed, to draw back, but he is
distinguished from one that draws back to perdition; as it is
said in the following verse, ‘We are not of them who draw
back to perdition, but of them that believe, to the saving of
the soul.’ Such a drawing back as this, though it shall not
end in perdition, inasmuch as the person shall be recovered and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>brought to repentance; yet it shall be attended with very great
marks of God’s displeasure against believers, for those sins
which they have committed, as well as others; accordingly,
<i>his soul having no pleasure</i> in them, denotes that he would, in
various instances, reveal his wrath against relapsing believers,
as a display of his holiness, who shall nevertheless be recovered
and saved at last. If these things be duly considered, the
objection seems to have no weight in it, though it should be
allowed, that the words upon which it is principally founded,
are not rightly translated.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, I cannot see sufficient reason to set aside our translation,
it being equally just to render the words, <i>if any man
draw back</i><a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a>; since the supplying the words <i>any man</i>, or <i>any
one</i>, is allowed of in many other instances, both in the Old and
New Testament. Therefore there is not the least incongruity
in its being supplied in the text under our present consideration<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a>;
and, if it be, the sense that we give of it, will appear
very agreeable to the context; accordingly the meaning is,
‘The just shall live by faith,’ or they who ‘know in themselves
that they have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,’
as in one of the foregoing verses: These shall live by faith,
but as for others who do not live by faith, having only a form
or shew of religion, ‘whose manner is to forsake the assembling
of themselves together,’ as in verse 25. these are inclined
to <i>draw back</i>; therefore, let them know that <i>if any one</i>, or
<i>whosoever draws back</i>, it will be at their peril; for it will be
to their own <i>perdition</i>; yet saith the apostle, that true believers
may not be discouraged by the apostacy of others, let
them take notice of what is said in the following words, ‘We
are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>that believe, to the saving of the soul.’ These things being
duly considered, it will be sufficiently evident that this text does
not militate against the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 4. There is another objection brought against the doctrine
we have been endeavouring to maintain, taken from what
the apostle says in Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6. ‘It is impossible for those
who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly
gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance,
seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame.’ The force of this objection
lies in two things, <i>viz.</i> that they are described as total and final
apostates; and also, that according to the account we have
of their former conversation, they appear then to have been
true believers.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> This is thought, by some, who defend the doctrine
of the saints’ perseverance, to be one of the most difficult objections
that we generally meet with against it; especially they
who cannot see how it is possible for a person to make such
advances towards true godliness, and yet be no other than an
hypocrite or formal professor, are obliged to take a method to
set aside the force of the objection, which I cannot give into,
namely, that when the apostle says, <i>It is impossible</i> that such
should be <i>renewed again to repentance</i>; the word <i>impossible</i>
denotes nothing else, but that the thing is exceeding difficult,
not that they shall eventually perish; because they are supposed
to be true believers; but their recovery after such a notorious
instance of backsliding, shall be attended with difficulties
so great that nothing can surmount, but the extraordinary
power of God; and though he will recover them, yet they shall
feel the smart thereof as long as they live; they shall be saved,
yet so as by fire<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>But notwithstanding the word <i>impossible</i> may be sometimes
taken for that which is very difficult, I cannot but conclude
that the apostle is here speaking of that which is impossible,
with respect to the event, and therefore, that he is giving the
character of apostates who shall never be recovered. This appears,
not only from the heinousness of the crime, as they are
said <i>to crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him
to an open shame</i>; but from what is mentioned in the following
verses, in which they are compared to <i>the earth that bringeth
forth thorns and briars, which is rejected, and nigh unto cursing,
whose end is to be burned</i>; and from their being distinguished
from those who shall be saved, concerning whom the
apostle was <i>persuaded better things, and things that accompany
salvation</i>; therefore he is speaking here concerning a total and
final apostasy.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that this may not appear to militate against the doctrine
we are maintaining, I shall endeavour to shew, that notwithstanding
the character the apostle gives of the persons he here
speaks of they were destitute of the truth of grace, and therefore
nothing is said concerning them, but what a formal professor
may attain to: That this may appear let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That they are described as <i>once enlightened</i>; but this a
person may be, and yet be destitute of saving faith. If by being
<i>enlightened</i> we understand their having been baptized, as
some critics take the word, which was afterwards, in some following
ages, used in that sense, it might easily be alleged,
that a person might be baptized and yet not be a true believer:
But since I question whether baptism was expressed by illumination
in the apostles age<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a>, I would rather understand by
it, their having been convinced of the truth of the gospel, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>yielded an assent to the doctrines contained therein. Now this
a person may do, and yet be destitute of saving faith, which is
seated not barely in the understanding, but in the will, and therefore
supposes him not only to be rightly informed, with respect
to those things which are the object of faith, but to be internally
and effectually called, from whence saving faith proceeds,
as has been before observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They are said to have <i>tasted the good word of God</i>; which
agrees with the character before given of those who had a temporary
faith<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a>, who seemed, for a while, pleased with the word,
and their affections were raised in hearing it; as Herod is said
to have <i>heard John the Baptist gladly, and to have done many
things</i>; like those whom our Saviour compares to the seed
sown in stony ground, which soon sprang up, but afterwards
withered away. This a person may do, and yet not have saving
faith; for it is one thing to approve of, and be affected
with the word, and another thing to mix it with that faith
which accompanies salvation. A person may entertain those
doctrines contained in the word which relate to a future state
of blessedness with pleasure; as all men desire to be happy, and
at the same time be far from practising the duties of self-denial,
taking up the cross, and following Christ, mortifying indwelling
sin, and exercising an intire dependance upon, and resignation
to him in all things: This contains much more than
what is expressed by <i>tasting the good word of God</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They are farther described as having <i>tasted the heavenly
gift, and being made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and of the
powers of the world to come</i>; all which expressions, I humbly
conceive, carry in them no more than this, that they had been
enabled to work miracles, or that they had a faith of miracles,
which has been before described<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a>, and proved to fall very
short of saving faith<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a>. Therefore these characters given of
them do not argue that they were true believers, and consequently
the objection, which depends on the supposition that
they were, is of no force to prove that saints may totally or
finally fall from grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 5. The next objection against the doctrine we have
been maintaining, is taken from Heb. x. 29. <i>Of how much sorer
punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of
the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>hath done despite unto the spirit of grace.</i> The crime here spoken
of is of the heinous nature, and the greatest punishment is
said to be inflicted for it: Now, inasmuch as these are described
as having been <i>sanctified by the blood of the covenant</i>, it
follows, that they were true believers, and consequently true believers
may apostatize, and fall short of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> The force of the objection lies principally in those
words, <i>the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified</i>;
which expression is taken, by divines, in two different senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some take the word <i>he</i> in the same sense as it is taken in
the objection, as referring to the apostate; and then the difficulty
which occurs, is how such an one could be said to be
sanctified by the blood of the covenant, and yet not regenerate,
effectually called, or a true believer: To solve this, they suppose,
that by <i>sanctification</i> we are only to understand a relative
holiness, which such have who are made partakers of the
common grace of the gospel: Thus it is said, <i>Israel was holiness
unto the Lord</i>, Jer. ii. 3. or, as the apostle Peter expresses
it, <i>an holy nation</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 9. as they were God’s people by
an external covenant relation, and by an explicit consent to be
governed by those laws which he gave them when they first
became a church, Exod. xxiv. 3. and publicly avouched him
to be their God, and he avouched them to be his peculiar people,
which was done upon some solemn occasions, Deut. xxvi.
17, 18. Nevertheless, many of them were destitute of the special
grace of sanctification, as it contains in it a thorough and
universal change of heart and life. Moreover, they suppose
that this privilege of being God’s people, by an external covenant-relation,
together with all these common gifts and graces
that attend it, was purchased by, and founded on the blood of
Christ, which is called <i>the blood of the covenant</i>, inasmuch as
he was <i>given for a covenant of the people</i>, Isa. xlii. 6. and pursuant
hereunto, he shed his blood to procure for them the external
as well as the saving blessings of the covenant of grace;
the former of these, the persons here described as apostates, are
supposed to have been made partakers of, as the apostle says,
<i>To them pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants,
and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the
promises</i>, Rom. ix. 4. they worshipped him in all his ordinances,
as those whom the prophet speaks of, <i>who seek him daily,
and delight to know his ways, as a nation that did righteousness,
and forsook not the ordinance of their God; they ask of him the
ordinances of justice, and take delight in approaching to God</i>;
and yet these things were not done by faith, Isa. lviii. 2. In
this respect persons may be sanctified, and yet afterwards forfeit,
neglect, despise and forsake these ordinances, and lose the
external privileges of the covenant of grace, which they once had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and so become apostates. This is the most common method
used to solve the difficulty contained in the objection. But I
would rather acquiesce in another way, which may be taken to
account for the sense of those words, <i>the blood of the covenant
wherewith he was sanctified</i>. Therefore, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That the word <i>he</i> may be understood, not as referring to
the apostate, but our Saviour, who is spoken of immediately
before: thus the apostate is said to ‘trample under foot the Son
of God, and count the blood of the covenant wherewith He,
that is, Christ, ‘was sanctified, an unholy thing.’ That this
sense may appear just, it may be observed, that Christ was
sanctified or set apart by the Father, to perform all the branches
of his Mediatorial office, in two respects.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As he was fore-ordained or appointed, by him, to come
into the world to shed his blood for the redemption of his
people: thus his undertaking to redeem them is called his
sanctifying, or devoting himself to perform this work, as he
says, ‘For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might
be sanctified through the truth,’ John xvii. 19. this he did in
pursuance of the eternal transaction between the Father and
him, relating hereunto. But it will be said, that this was antecedent
to his dying for them; and therefore, properly speaking,
he could not be said, in this respect, to be <i>sanctified by
the blood of the covenant</i>; therefore, to this we may add,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That he was also sanctified, or set apart by the Father,
to apply the work of redemption after he had purchased it;
which sanctification was, in the most proper sense, the result
of his shedding his blood, which was the blood of the covenant;
so that as he was ‘brought again from the dead,’ as the
apostle speaks, ‘through the blood of the everlasting covenant,’
Heb. xiii. 20. all the blessings which he applies to his
people as the consequence hereof, are the result of his being
sanctified, or set apart to carry on and perfect the work of our
salvation, the foundation whereof was laid in his blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, that they who are here described as apostates,
had not before this, the grace of faith, is evident from the
context, inasmuch as they are distinguished from true believers.
The apostle seems to speak of two sorts of persons, to wit,
some who had cast off the ordinances of God’s worship, ‘forsaking
the assembling of themselves together,’ who are distinguished
from those whom he dehorts from this sin, who <i>had</i>
the grace of <i>faith</i>, whereby they were enabled to ‘draw near
to God in full assurance thereof, having their hearts sprinkled
from an evil conscience, and their bodies washed with pure
water;’ concerning these he says, ‘We are not of them who
draw back to perdition, but of them who believe to the saving
of the soul,’ chap. x. 39. Therefore we must conclude that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>others are intended in the text under our present consideration,
who were not true believers, and consequently it does not from
hence appear that such may totally, or finally, fall from a state
of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>The apostates spoken of in this and the foregoing objection,
were probably some among the Jews, to whom the gospel was
preached, who embraced the Christian faith, being convinced
by those miracles which were wrought for that purpose, but
afterwards revolted from it, and were more inveterately set
against Christ and the gospel than they had been before they
made this profession; and accordingly as they had formerly
approved of the crimes of those who crucified Christ, in which
respect they are said to have crucified him; now they do, in
the same sense, crucify him afresh. And as they had been
made partakers of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost;
afterwards they openly blasphemed him, and this was done
with spite and malice. These texts therefore not only contain
a sad instance of the apostasy of some, but prove that they
were irrecoverably lost; and this comes as near the account we
have in the gospels of the unpardonable sin, as any thing mentioned
in scripture: nevertheless, what has been said to prove
that they never were true believers, is a sufficient answer to
this and the foregoing objection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> 6. Another objection against the doctrine of the saints’
perseverance, is taken from 2 Pet. ii. 20-22. <i>For if after they
have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
therein, and overcome; the latter end is worse with them than
the beginning</i>; and they are said in the following verse, to <i>turn
from the holy commandment delivered unto them</i>; which is compared
to the <i>dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow
that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That though every one
must conclude, that the persons, whom the apostle here speaks
of, plainly appear to be apostates; yet there is nothing in their
character which argues that they apostatized, or fell from the
truth of grace; and it is only such whom we are at present
speaking of. It may be observed, that the apostle is so far from
including these apostates in the number of those to whom he
writes this, with the foregoing epistle, whom he describes <i>as
elect, according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ</i>, and as having been <i>begotten again unto
a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, to an inheritance
reserved for them in heaven</i>, and as such, who should be
<i>kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation</i>, 1 Pet.
i. 2-5. that he plainly distinguishes them from them. For in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>verse 1, of this chapter, from whence it is taken, it is said,
‘There shall be false teachers among you, and many shall follow
their pernicious ways;’ he does not say many, who are
now of your number, but many who shall be joined to the
church, when these false teachers arise. These persons, indeed,
are represented as making a great shew of religion, by which
they gained reputation among some professors, whom they seduced
which otherwise they could not have done; and therefore
it is said, ‘They had escaped the pollutions of the world,
through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,’
and that they had ‘known the way of righteousness.’ Such
might indeed be joined to the church afterwards; but they did
not now belong to it; and what is said concerning them,
amounts to no more than an external visible reformation, together
with their having attained the knowledge of Christ and
divine things; so that they were enlightened in the doctrines
of the gospel; though they made it appear, by the methods they
used to deceive others, that they had not experienced the grace
of the gospel themselves, and therefore they fell away from
their profession, and turned aside from the faith, which once
they preached. It is one thing for a formal professor, who
makes a great show of religion, to turn aside from his profession,
to all excess of riot; and another thing to suppose a true
believer can do so, and that to such a degree as to continue
therein; this the grace of God will keep him from.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> 7. Another objection against the doctrine of the saints’
perseverance, is taken from the parable of the debtor and creditor,
in Matt, xviii. 26, <i>&amp;c.</i> in which it is said, ‘The servant
fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience
with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the Lord of that
servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and
forgave him the debt;’ but afterwards, upon his treating one
of his fellow-servants, who owed him a very inconsiderable
sum, with great severity, his lord exacted the debt of him,
which he had before forgiven him, and so <i>delivered</i> him <i>to the
tormentors</i>, till he should pay all that was due to him: ‘So
likewise,’ it is said, ‘shall my heavenly Father do unto you, if
ye, from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
trespasses;’ from whence it is inferred, that a person may
fall from a justified state, or that God may forgive sin at one
time, and yet be provoked to alter his resolution, and inflict the
punishment that is due to it, at another; which is altogether
inconsistent with the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance in
grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In answer to this we must observe, that our Saviour’s
design in his parables, is not that every word or circumstance
contained in them, should be applied to signify what it seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>to import, but there is some truth in general intended to be illustrated
thereby, which is principally to be regarded therein.
Thus in the parable of the <i>judge</i>, in Luke xviii. 2, &amp;c. ‘which
feared not God, neither regarded man,’ who was moved, by a
widow’s importunity, to ‘avenge her of her adversary;’ which
after a while, he resolved to do, because the widow <i>troubled
him</i>. This is applied to ‘God’s avenging his elect, who cry day
and night unto him;’ where we must observe, that it is only
in this circumstance that the parable is to be applied to them
without any regard had to the injustice of the judge, or his being
uneasy, by reason of the importunity which the widow exprest
in pleading her cause with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in the parable of the <i>steward</i>, in Luke xvi. 1, &amp;c.
who being accused for having <i>wasted his lord’s goods</i>; and
apprehending that he should be soon turned out of the stewardship,
he takes an unjust method to gain the favour of his lord’s
debtors, by remitting a part of what they owed him, that by
this means they might be induced to shew kindness to him when
he was turned out of his service. It is said indeed, verse 8.
that ‘the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had
acted wisely;’ whereas, our Saviour does not design, in the account
he gives of his injustice, to give the least countenance
to it, as though it were to be imitated by us; nor by his lord’s
commending him as acting wisely for himself, does he intend
that it is lawful or commendable for wicked men to pursue the
like measures to promote their future interest. But the only
thing in which this parable is applied, is, that we might learn
from hence, that ‘the children of this world are, in their generation
wiser than the children of light;’ and that men ought to
endeavour, without the least appearance of injustice, to gain the
friendship of others, by using what they have in the world, in
such a way, as that they may be induced, out of gratitude for
those favours, which they conferred upon them, to shew respect
to them; but principally, that in performing what was
really their duty, they might have ground to hope that they
shall be approved of God, and received into everlasting habitations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to apply this rule to the parable from whence the objection
is taken, we must consider, that the design hereof is not
to signify that God changes his mind, as men do, by forgiving
persons at one time, and afterwards condemning them, as
though he did not know, when he extended this kindness to
them, how they would behave towards others, or whether they
would improve or forfeit this privilege; since to suppose this
would be contrary to the divine perfections. Therefore the
only design of the parable is to shew, that they who now conclude
that God has forgiven them, ought to forgive others, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>else they will find themselves mistaken at last: and though according
to the tenor of the divine dispensations, or the revealed
will of God, which is our only rule of judging concerning
this matter, they think that they are in a justified state, it will
appear, that the debt which they owed was not cancelled, but
shall be exacted of them to the utmost, in their own persons;
so that all that can be proved from hence is, that a man may
fall from, or lose those seeming grounds, which we had to conclude
that his sins were forgiven: but we are not to suppose
that our Saviour intends hereby that God’s secret purpose, relating
to the forgiveness of sin, can be changed; or that he,
who is really freed from condemnation, at one time, may fall
under it at another: therefore, what is said in this parable,
does not in the least give countenance to this objection, or
overthrow the doctrine we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> 8. There is another objection, taken from what the
apostle Paul says concerning himself, in 1 Cor. ix. 27. <i>I keep
under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any
means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
cast-away.</i> Now it is certain that the apostle was a true believer;
yet he concludes, that if he did not behave himself so
as to subdue or keep under his corrupt passions, but should
commit those open scandalous crimes, which they would prompt
him to, he should, in the end, become a cast-away, that is, apostatize
from God, and be rejected by him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That though the apostle
had as good ground to conclude that he had experienced the
grace of God in truth, as any man, and was oftentimes favoured
with a full assurance hereof; yet he did not attain this assurance
by immediate revelation, so as he received those doctrines
which he was to impart to the church as a rule of faith;
for then it would have been impossible for him to have been
mistaken as to this matter: and if this be supposed, then I
would understand what he says concerning his being <i>a cast-away</i>,
as denoting what would be the consequence of his <i>not
keeping under his body</i>; but not implying hereby that corrupt
nature should so far prevail, as that he should fall from a sanctified
state. Now if he did not attain this assurance by immediate
revelation, then he had it in the same way as others have,
by making use of those marks and characters which are given
of the truth of grace; and accordingly he argues, that though,
at present, he thought himself to be in a sanctified state, from
the same evidences that others conclude themselves to be so;
yet if corrupt nature should prevail over him, which it would
do, if he did not keep his body in subjection, or if he were
guilty of those vile abominations which unregenerate persons
are chargeable with, then it would appear, that this assurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>was ill grounded, his hope of salvation delusive, and he no
other than an hypocrite; and so, notwithstanding his having
preached to others, he would be found, in the end, among them
who were false professors, and accordingly rejected of God:
therefore we may observe, that it is one thing for a person to
exercise that caution, and use those means to prevent sin, which,
if he should commit, would prove him an hypocrite; and another
thing for one that is a true believer, to be suffered to commit
those sins whereby he would apostatize from God, and so
miss of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this will serve to answer another objection that is usually
brought against the doctrine we are maintaining, as though
it were inconsistent with that holy fear which believers ought
to have of falling, as an inducement to care and watchfulness
in the discharge of their duty; as it is said in Prov. xxviii. 14.
<i>Happy is the man that feareth always</i>; inasmuch as we must
distinguish between that fear of caution, which is a preservative
against sin, and includes a watchfulness over our actions,
that we may not dishonour God thereby; and an unbelieving
fear, that though we are in a state of grace, and are enabled
to exercise that diligence and circumspection that becomes
christians, yet we have no foundation whereon to set our foot,
or ground to hope for salvation. Or, it is one thing to fear,
lest we should, by giving way to sin, dishonour God, grieve
his Spirit, and wound our own consciences, and do that which
is a disgrace to the gospel, through the prevalency of corrupt
nature, whereby we shall have ground to conclude that we
thought ourselves something when we were nothing, deceiving
our own souls; and another thing to fear that we shall perish
and fall, though our hearts are right with God, and we have
reason to expect that we shall be kept by his power, through
faith, unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall conclude this answer with some few inferences
from what has been said, to prove the doctrine of the saints’
perseverance as contained therein. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Since we do not pretend to assert that all who make a
profession of religion are assured that they shall never apostatize,
but only true believers, let unbelievers take no encouragement
from hence to conclude, that it shall be well with them
in the end. Many are externally called who are not really
sanctified; and presume that they shall be saved, though, without
ground, inasmuch as they continue in impenitency and unbelief;
such have no warrant to take comfort from the doctrine
we have been maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We may, from what has been said, observe the difference
between the security of a believer’s state, as his hope is fixed
on the stability of the covenant, and the promises thereof, relating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>to his salvation, together with the Spirit’s witness, with
ours, concerning our own sincerity; and that which we generally
call carnal security, whereby a person thinks himself safe,
or that all things shall go well with him, though he make provision
for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof: This is an unwarrantable
security in a state of unregeneracy, or licentiousness,
which this doctrine does not in the least give countenance
to.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. From what has been said concerning the apostasy of
some from that faith which they once made a profession of,
we may infer; that it is only the grace of God experienced in
truth, that will preserve us from turning aside from the faith
of the gospel. The apostle speaks of some who, by embracing
those doctrines that were subversive of the gospel, are <i>fallen
from grace</i>, Gal. v. 4. that is, from the doctrines of grace; concerning
whom he says, that <i>Christ profited them nothing</i>, or
was <i>become of no effect to them</i>, chap. v. 2, 4. that is, the gospel,
which contains a display of the glory of Christ, was of no
saving advantage to them. All the sad instances we have of
many, who are tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine,
and are made a prey to those that lie in wait to deceive, proceed
from their being destitute of the grace of God, which
would have a tendency to preserve them from turning aside
from the faith of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Let us be exhorted to be as diligent and watchful against
the breakings forth of corruption, and endeavour to avoid all
occasions of sin, as much as though perseverance in grace were
to be ascribed to our own endeavours, or as though God had
given us no ground to conclude that he would enable us to persevere;
and yet, at the same time, depend on his assistance,
without which this blessing cannot be attained, and hope in his
mercy and faithfulness, and lay hold on the promises which he
has given us, that it shall go well with us in the end, or that
we shall have all joy and peace in believing.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Let us not only endeavour to persevere, but grow in grace;
which two blessings are joined together; as it is said, <i>The righteous
also shall hold on his way; and he that hath clean hands
shall be stronger and stronger</i>, Job xvii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. This doctrine has a great tendency to support and fortify
believers, under the most adverse dispensations of providence,
which, at any time, they are liable to; and to comfort them under
all the assaults of their spiritual enemies; since though
they may be suffered to discourage or give them interruption
in the exercise of those graces which they have experienced,
yet grace shall not be wholly extinguished. And sometimes,
by the over-ruling providence of God, those things which in
themselves have a tendency to weaken their faith, shall be ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>as a means to increase it; so that when they can do nothing
in their own strength, they may be enabled, by depending
on Christ, and receiving strength from him, to prevail against
all the opposition they meet with, and come off <i>more than
conquerors</i>, at last, <i>through him that loved them</i>, Rom. viii. 37.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-80' class='c003'>Quest. LXXX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXX.</span> <i>Can true believers be infallibly assured that
they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere
therein unto salvation?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavour to walk
in all good conscience before him, may, without extraordinary
revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God’s
promises, and by the Spirit, enabling them to discern in themselves
those graces to which the promises of life are made,
and bearing witness with their spirits, that they are the children
of God, be infallibly assured that they are in a state of
grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having before considered a believer as made partaker
of those graces of the Holy Spirit that accompany salvation,
whereby his state is rendered safe, and also that he shall
not draw back unto perdition, but shall attain the end of his
faith, even the salvation of his soul; it is necessary for the
establishing of his comfort and joy, that he should know himself
to be interested in this privilege. It is a great blessing to
be redeemed by Christ, and sanctified by the Spirit; but it is
a superadded privilege to know that we are so, or be assured
that we are in a state of grace, which is the subject insisted on
in this answer: In which we are led,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To speak something concerning the nature of assurance,
and how far persons may be said to be infallibly assured of
their salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall endeavour to prove that this blessing is attainable
in this life.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We shall consider the character of those to whom it
belongs. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. The means whereby it may be attained.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the nature of assurance, and how far persons
may be said to be infallibly assured of their salvation. Assurance
is opposed to doubting; which is inconsistent therewith;
so that he who has attained this privilege, is carried above all
those doubts and fears respecting the truth of grace, and his
interest in the love of God, which others are exposed to, whereby
their lives are rendered very uncomfortable: It may also
be considered as containing in it something more than our being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>enabled to hope that we are in a state of grace; for though
that affords relief against despair, yet it falls short of assurance,
which is sometimes called <i>a full assurance of hope</i>, Heb. vi. 11.
and it certainly contains a great deal more than a probability,
or a conjectural persuasion relating to this matter; which is
the only thing that some will allow to be attainable by believers,
especially they who deny the doctrine of the saints’ perseverance,
and lay the greatest stress of man’s salvation on his
own free-will, rather than the efficacious grace of God. All
that they will own as to this matter is, that persons may be in
a hopeful way to salvation, and that it is probable they may attain
it at last. But they cannot be fully assured that they shall,
unless they were assured concerning their perseverance, which,
they suppose, no one can be; because the carrying on of the
work of grace depends on the free-will of man, as well as the
first beginning of it; and according to their notion of liberty,
as has been before observed under another answer<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a>, <i>viz.</i> that
he who acts freely may act the contrary; and consequently,
since every thing that is done in the carrying on of the work
of grace, is done freely; no one can be assured that this work
shall not miscarry; therefore none can attain assurance; this
is what some assert, but we deny. And it is observed in this
answer, that believers may not only attain assurance that they
are in a state of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation,
but that they may be infallibly assured hereof, which is
the highest degree of assurance. How far this is attainable by
believers, may be the subject of our farther inquiry.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a matter of dispute among some, whether assurance admits
of any degrees, or whether a person can be said to be
more or less assured of a thing? or whether that which does
not amount to the highest degree of certainty, may be called
assurance? This is denied, by some, for this reason; because
assurance is the highest and strongest assent that can be given
to the truth of any proposition; accordingly the least defect
of evidence on which it is supposed to be founded, leaves the
mind in a proportionable degree of doubt, as to the truth of it;
in which case there may be a probability, but not an assurance.
If this method of explaining the meaning of the word be true,
then it is beyond dispute, that they who have attained assurance
of their being in a state of grace, may be said to be infallibly
assured thereof: Whether this be the sense of that expression
in this answer, I will not pretend to determine; neither shall I
enter any farther into this dispute, which amounts to little more
than what concerns the propriety or impropriety of the sense
of the word <i>assurance</i>. All that I shall add concerning it, is,
that according to our common mode of speaking it is reckoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>no absurdity for a person to say he is sure of a thing, though
it be possible for him to have greater evidence of the truth
thereof, and consequently a greater degree of assurance. Thus
the assurance that arises from the possession of a thing cannot
but be greater than that which attends the bare expectation of
it: Therefore whatever be the sense of that infallible assurance,
which is here spoken of; we cannot suppose that there is any
degree of assurance attainable in this life, concerning the happiness
of the saints in heaven, equal to that which they have
who are actually possessed of that blessedness; to suppose this
would be to confound earth and heaven together, or expectation
with actual fruition.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what relates to our assurance thereof, there is another
matter of dispute among some, which I am not desirous to enter
into; namely, whether it is possible for a believer to be as
sure that he shall be saved, as he is that he exists, or that he
is a sinner, and so stands in need of salvation? or whether it
is possible for a person to be as sure that he shall be saved, as
he is sure of that truth which is matter of pure revelation, viz.
that he, that believes shall be saved? or whether it is possible
for a person to be as sure that he has the truth of grace, as he
may be that he performs any actions, whether natural or religious;
such as speaking, praying, reading, hearing, &amp;c. or
whether we may be as sure that we have a principle of grace,
as we are that we put forth such actions, as seem to proceed
from that principle, when engaged in the performance of some
religious duties? If any are disposed to defend the possibility
of our attaining assurance in so great a degree as this, as what
they think to be the meaning of what some divines have asserted,
agreeably to what is contained in this answer, that a believer
may be infallibly assured of his salvation, I will not enter
the list with them; though I very much question whether it
will not be a matter of too great difficulty for them to support
their argument, without the least appearance of exception to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, (that I may not extenuate or deny the privileges
which some saints have been favoured with, who have been,
as it were, in the suburbs of heaven, and not only had a prelibation,
but a kind of sensation, of the enjoyments thereof, and
expressed as full an assurance as though they had been actually
in heaven); it cannot be denied that this, in various instances,
has amounted, as near as possible, to an assurance of infallibility;
and that such a degree of assurance has been attained,
by some believers, both in former and later ages, will be
proved under a following head, which, I am apt to think, is
what is intended in this answer, by the possibility of a believer’s
being infallibly assured of salvation. But let it be considered,
that these are uncommon instances, in which the Spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>of God, by his immediate testimony, has favoured them
with, as to this matter, which are not to be reckoned as a standard,
whereby we may judge of that assurance which God’s
children desire, and sometimes enjoy, which falls short of it:
Therefore, when God is pleased to give a believer such a degree
of assurance, as carries him above all his doubts and fears,
with respect to his being in a state of grace, and fills him with
those joys which arise from hence, that are unspeakable, and
full of glory; this is that assurance which we are now to consider,
which, in this answer is called an infallible assurance;
whether it be more or less properly so called, we have nothing
farther to add; but shall proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To prove that this privilege is attainable in this present
life; and that it may appear to be so, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That if the knowledge of other things which are of less
importance, be attainable, then certainly it is possible for us to
attain that which is of the greatest importance. This argument
is founded on the goodness of God; if he has given us sufficient
means to lead us into the knowledge of other things,
which respect our comfort and happiness in this world; has he
left us altogether destitute of those means whereby we may
conclude, that it shall go well with us in a better? God has
sometimes been pleased to favour his people with some intimations
concerning the blessings of common providence, which
they might expect for their encouragement, under the trials
and difficulties which they were to meet with in the world; and
our Saviour encourages his disciples to expect, that notwithstanding
their present destitute circumstances, as to outward
things; yet their <i>Father</i>, who <i>knows that they had need of them</i>,
would supply their wants; and therefore they had no reason
to be over-solicitous in <i>taking thought what they should eat and
drink, and wherewithal they should be clothed</i>, Matt. vi. 31, 32.
and if God, that he may encourage the faith of his people, gives
them assurance that <i>no temptation shall befal them, but what is
common to men</i>; or, that they shall not be pressed down, so as
to sink and despair of help from him, under the burdens and
difficulties that, in the course of his providence, he lays on
them; I say, if God is pleased to give such intimations to his
people, with respect to their condition in this world, that they
may be assured that it shall go well with them, as to many
things that concern their outward circumstances therein; may
we not conclude from hence, that the assurance of those things
that concern their everlasting salvation may be attained? or,
if the promises that respect the one may be depended on so as
to afford relief against all doubts and fears that may arise from
our present circumstances in the world; may we not, with as
good reason, suppose, that the promises which respect the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to wit, the carrying on and perfecting the work of grace, afford
equal matter of encouragement; and consequently, that the
one is as much to be depended on, as the other; so that as the
apostle says, they who have fled for refuge, to lay hold on the
hope set before them, may have strong consolation arising from
thence, Heb. vi. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> It will be objected to this, that the promises that respect
outward blessings are not always fulfilled, and therefore
we cannot be assured concerning our future condition, as to
outward circumstances in the world; though godliness, as the
apostle says, hath the promise of the world that now is, as well
as that which is to come. This appears from the uncommon
instances of affliction, that the best men often meet with, which
others are exempted from. Therefore the promises which respect
the carrying on and completing the work of grace, will
not afford that assurance of salvation which we suppose a believer
may attain to, as founded thereon.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In answer to this it may be replied, that the promises
of outward blessings are always fulfilled, either in kind or
value. Sometimes the destitute state of believers, as to the
good things of this life, is abundantly compensated with those
spiritual blessings, which are, at present, bestowed on, or reserved
for them hereafter; and therefore, if their condition in
the world be attended with little else but affliction, they have
no reason to say that they are disappointed; for while they are
denied the lesser, they have the greater blessings instead thereof,
so that their assurance of the accomplishment of the promises
of outward blessings, must be understood with this limitation:
but as to spiritual blessings, which God has promised
to his people, there is no foundation for any distinction of their
being made good in kind or in value; if the promise of eternal
life be not made good according to the letter of it, it cannot be,
in any sense, said to be accomplished: therefore, since God
gives his people these promises as a foundation of hope, we may
conclude from thence, that the assurance of believers, relating
to their salvation, is as much to be depended on as the assurance
they have, founded on the promises of God, concerning
any blessings which may tend to support them in their present
condition in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That assurance of justification, sanctification and salvation,
may be attained in this life, is farther evident from the
obligations which persons are under to pray for these privileges,
and to bless God for the experience which they have of
the one, and the ground which they have to expect the other.
That it is our duty to pray for them is no less certain than that
we stand in need of them; this therefore being taken for granted,
it may be inferred from hence, that there is some way by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>which we may know that our prayers are answered, the contrary
to which would be a very discouraging consideration;
neither could the experience hereof be alleged as a motive to
the performance of the duty of prayer, as the Psalmist says,
<i>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come</i>, Psal.
lxv. 2. Nor could any believer have the least reason to say as
he does elsewhere, <i>Verily God hath heard me, he hath attended
to the voice of my prayer</i>, Psal. lxvi. 19. And the apostle says,
that <i>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us</i>,
1 John v. 14, 15. and this is said in the following words, to be
known by us, we know that we have the petitions that we desired
of him; therefore it follows, that we may know from the
exercise of faith in prayer, for the forgiveness of sin, that our
iniquities are forgiven; the same may be said concerning the
subject-matter of our prayer for all other blessings that accompany
salvation; and consequently it is possible for us to know
whether God has granted us these blessings or no.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if it be replied to this, that it is not absolutely necessary
that an humble suppliant should have any intimations given
him, that his petition shall be granted; or that it would be a
very unbecoming thing for such an one to say, that he will not
ask for a favour, if he be not sure before-hand that it will he
bestowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be answered, That we are not only to pray
for saving blessings, but to praise God for our experience thereof;
as it is said, <i>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me</i>, Psal. l. 23.
and <i>praise is comely for the upright</i>, Psal. xxxiii. 1. Now this
supposes that we know that God has bestowed the blessings
we prayed for upon us. If the Psalmist calls upon his soul to
<i>bless the Lord for forgiving</i> him <i>all his iniquities</i>, Psal. ciii. 2,
3. we must suppose that there was some method by which he
attained the assurance of the blessing which he praises God
for; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That some have attained this privilege, therefore it is not
impossible for others to attain it. That some have been assured
of their salvation, is evident from the account we have
thereof in several scriptures, Thus the apostle tells the church
he writes to, <i>God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
salvation</i>, 1 Thes. v. 7. and he says concerning himself, <i>I know
whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep
that which I have committed unto him, against that day</i>, 2 Tim.
i. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> To this it is objected, that though it is true, some persons
of old, have experienced this privilege, yet it does not
follow from hence that we have any ground to expect it; since
they attained it by extraordinary revelation, in that age in which
they were favoured with the spirit of inspiration, whereby they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>arrived to the knowledge of things future, even such as it was
impossible for them otherwise to have known, at least, they
could not without these extraordinary intimations, have arrived
to any more than a probable conjecture concerning this
matter; and this is not denied by those who oppose the doctrine
of assurance: whereas, to pretend to more than this, is
to suppose that we have it by extraordinary inspiration, which,
at present, can be reckoned no other than enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That though God does not
give the church, at present, the least ground to expect extraordinary
intimations concerning their interest in spiritual and saving
blessings, as he formerly did; yet we must not conclude
that there is no method whereby they may attain the assurance
hereof in a common and ordinary way, by the internal testimony
of the Spirit; which, as will farther appear under a following
head, differs very much from enthusiasm; since it is attended
with, and founded on those evidences which God has
given hereof in scripture, which they, in a way of self-examination,
are enabled to apprehend in themselves. That this may
appear, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That there never was any privilege conferred upon the
church by extraordinary revelation, while that dispensation was
continued therein, but the same, or some other which is equivalent
thereunto, is still conferred in an ordinary way, provided
it be absolutely necessary for the advancing the glory of God,
and their edification and consolation in Christ. If this were
not true, the church could hardly subsist, much less would the
present dispensation of the covenant of grace excel the other
which the church was under in former ages, as to those spiritual
privileges which they have ground to expect. It is, I think, allowed
by all, that the gospel-dispensation, not only in the beginning
thereof, when extraordinary gifts were conferred, but
in its continuance, now they are ceased, excels that which went
before it, with respect to the spiritual privileges which are conferred
therein. Now if God was pleased formerly to converse
with men in an extraordinary way, and thereby give them an
intimation of things relating to their salvation, but, at present,
withholds not only the way and manner of revealing this to
them, but the blessings conveyed thereby; then it will follow,
that the church is in a worse state than it was before; or else
it must be supposed that these privileges are not absolutely necessary
to enable them to glorify God, which they do by offering
praise to him, and to their attaining that peace and joy
which they are given to expect in a way of believing; but if
the church were destitute of this privilege, it would be in a very
unhappy state, and retain nothing that could compensate the
loss of those extraordinary gifts that are now ceased.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>They who insist on this objection, and charge the doctrine
of assurance as what savours of enthusiasm, are obliged, by
their own method of reasoning, to apply the same objection to
the doctrine of internal, special, efficacious grace, which we
have, under a foregoing answer,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> proved to be the work of the
Spirit; and if these internal works are confined to the extraordinary
dispensation of the Spirit, then the church is at present
as much destitute of sanctification as it is of assurance. Therefore
we must conclude, that one no more savours of enthusiasm
than the other; or that we have ground to hope for assurance
of salvation, though not in an extraordinary way, as much as
the saints did in former ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Our Saviour has promised his people the Spirit to perform
what is necessary for the carrying on the work of grace
in all ages, even when extraordinary gifts should cease: accordingly
he says, <i>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
said unto you</i>, John xiv. 26. And elsewhere it is said, <i>Ye have
an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things</i>, 1 John
ii. 20. And to this privilege of assurance, it is said, <i>We have
received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of
God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us
of God</i>, 1 Cor. ii. 12. And there are many other promises of
the Spirit, which though they had their accomplishment, as to
what respects the conferring extraordinary gifts, in the first age
of the church; yet they have a farther accomplishment in what
the Spirit was to bestow on the church in the following ages
thereof, though in an ordinary way. This seems very evident
from scripture; inasmuch as the fruits of the Spirit are said to
appear in the exercise of those graces which believers have in
all ages, who never had extraordinary gifts: thus it is said,
<i>The fruit of the Spirit, is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance</i>, Gal. v. 22, 23.
Now if these graces be produced by the Spirit, as they are called
his fruits, and the exercise thereof be not confined to any
particular age of the church, then we must suppose that the
Spirit’s energy extends itself to all ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, believers are said, to be <i>led by the Spirit</i>, Rom. viii.
14. and this is assigned as an evidence of their being <i>the sons
of God</i>; and, on the other hand, it is said, <i>If any man have not
the spirit of Christ, he is none of his</i>, ver. 9. from whence we
may conclude, that there was, in the apostles’ days, an effusion
of the Spirit, common to all believers, besides that which was
conferred in an extraordinary way, on those who were favoured
with the gift of inspiration; otherwise, the having the Spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>would not have been considered as a privilege belonging only
to believers, and being destitute of it, an argument of a person’s
not belonging to Christ. As for the extraordinary dispensation
of the Holy Ghost, it was not inseparably connected
with salvation; for many had it who were Christians only in
name, and had nothing more than a form of godliness; and on
the other hand, many true believers brought forth those fruits
which proceeded from the Spirit, in an ordinary way, who had
not these extraordinary gifts conferred on them. Moreover the
apostle speaks of believers <i>through the Spirit mortifying the
deeds of the body</i>, Rom. viii. 13. Now if the work of mortification
be incumbent on believers in all ages, then the influences
of the Spirit, enabling hereunto, may be expected in all
ages. Now to apply this to our present argument; the Spirit’s
bearing witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God,
which is the foundation of that assurance which we are pleading
for, is, together with the other fruits and effects of the Spirit
but now mentioned, a privilege which believers, as such, are
given to desire and hope for, and stand in as much need of as
those who had this or other privileges conferred on them in an
extraordinary way, in the first age of the gospel-church.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to all this we might add, that the extraordinary gifts of
the Spirit at that time, were conferred on particular persons,
and not on whole churches; but assurance is considered, by
the apostle, as a privilege conferred on the church to which he
writes, that is, the greatest part of them, from whence the denomination
is taken; upon which account, the apostle speaking
to the believing Corinthians, says, <i>We know that if our earthy
house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of
God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens</i>, 2 Cor.
v. 1. by which he does not only intend himself and other ministers,
but the generality of believers, at that time, who are described
as walking by faith: and there are many other things
said concerning them in the foregoing and following verses;
which makes it sufficiently evident, that the apostle intends
more than himself and other ministers, when he speaks of their
having assurance, since many had it who were not made partakers
of extraordinary gifts. Therefore we must not conclude
that the church has, at present, no ground to expect this privilege,
so that they are liable to the charge of enthusiasm if
they do. But that this objection may farther appear not to be
sufficient to overthrow the argument we are maintaining, we
may appeal to the experience of many believers in this present
age, who pretend not to extraordinary revelation; and therefore
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) That many, in later ages, since extraordinary revelation
has ceased, have attained this privilege, and consequently it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>now attainable. To deny this would be to offend against the
generation of God’s people, of whom many have given their
testimony to this truth, who have declared what a comfortable
sense they have had of their interest in Christ, and the sensible
impressions they have enjoyed of his love shed abroad in
their hearts, whereby they have had, as it were, a prelibation
of the heavenly blessedness; and this has been attended with
the most powerful influence of the Spirit of God enabling them
to exercise those graces which have been agreeable to these
comfortable experiences, whereby they have been carried
through, and enabled to surmount the greatest difficulties
which have attended them in this life. And many have been
supported and comforted therewith, at the approach of death,
in which respect the sting thereof has been taken away, and
they have expressed themselves with a kind of triumph over
it, in the apostle’s words, <i>O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?</i> 1 Cor. xv. 55.</p>

<p class='c006'>That some have been favoured with this invaluable privilege
is undeniable; the account we have in the history of the
lives and deaths of many, who have been burning and shining
lights in their generation, puts it out of all doubt. And if this
were not sufficient, we might appeal to the experience of many
now living, since there is scarce any age or place in which the
gospel comes with power, but we have some instances of the
Spirit’s testimony to his own work, whereby it comes, with
much assurance, a comfortable sense of God’s love, peace of
conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, which is the first-fruits
and earnest of eternal life. But since this will be particularly
insisted on under a following answer<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a>, and farther proofs given
hereof; we may, at present, take it for granted, that many
have been assured of their being in a state of grace, who have
not made the least pretension, to inspiration; and to charge
them with enthusiasm, or a vain ungrounded delusion, is to
cast a reflection on the best of men, as well as on one of the
highest privileges which we can enjoy in this world.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible that it will be objected to this, that though
some have indeed expressed such a degree of assurance, yet
this will only afford conviction to those that have it, who are
best judges of their own experience, and the evidence whereon
it is founded; but this is not a sufficient proof to us, with respect
to whom it is only matter of report: And it may be said,
on the other hand, that it is possible they might be mistaken
who have been so sure of their own salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied, that it is very unreasonable to
suppose that all have been mistaken or deluded, who have declared
that they have been favoured with this blessing; charity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>will hardly admit of such a supposition; and if there be no
possibility of attaining this assurance, they must all have been
deceived, who have concluded that they had it. Moreover,
this privilege has been attained, not only by a few persons, and
these the more credulous part of mankind, or by such who have
not been able to assign any marks or evidences tending to support
it; but many believers have experienced it, who, at the
same time, have been far from discovering any weakness of
judgment, or disposition to unwarrantable credulity; yea, they
have enjoyed it at such a time when they have been most sensible
of the deceitfulness of their own hearts, and could not
but own that there was a peculiar hand of God herein; and the
same persons, when destitute of the Spirit’s testimony, have acknowledged
themselves to have used their utmost endeavours
to attain it, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the conviction which this will afford to us who are
destitute hereof; that though we suppose it true to a demonstration,
to those who have it, as being matter of sensation to
them, it is only matter of report to us; which we are no farther
bound to believe than we can depend on the credibility of
their evidence, who have declared that they have experienced
it. To this it may be replied, that if there be such a thing as
certainty founded on report, which to deny, would be the greatest
degree of scepticism; and if this has been transmitted to
us, by a great number of those who cannot be charged with
any thing that looks like a disposition to deceive either themselves
or others; then we are bound to believe, from their own
testimony, that there is such an assurance to be attained by
those who pretend not to receive it by extraordinary inspiration
from the Spirit of God. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. To consider the character of the persons to whom this
privilege belongs. Accordingly they are described in this answer,
as such who truly believe in Christ, and endeavour to
walk in all good conscience before him: these only have
ground to expect this privilege. It is an assurance of our having
the truth of grace that we are considering; which supposes
a person truly to believe in Christ; and accordingly it is distinguished
from that unwarrantable presumption whereby many
persuade themselves that they shall be saved, though they
be not sanctified. It is not <i>the hope of the hypocrite</i> we are
speaking of, which, as it is said, shall <i>perish</i>, and be <i>cut off;
whose trust shall be as the spider’s web</i>, which shall be swept
away with the besom of destruction, and be like the <i>giving up
of the ghost</i>, which shall end in everlasting despair, Job viii.
13, 14. and chap. xi. 20. but it is a well-grounded hope, such
as is accompanied with, and supported by the life of faith; so
that we are first enabled to act grace, and then to discern the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>truth thereof in our own souls, and accordingly reap the comfortable
fruits and effects that attend this assurance; as the apostle
prays in the behalf of the believing Romans, that <i>the
God of hope would fill them with all joy and peace in believing</i>,
Rom. xv. 13. So that an unbeliever has no right to this privilege,
and, indeed, from the nature of the thing, it is preposterous
for a person to be assured of that, which in itself has no
reality, as the apostle says, <i>If a man think himself to be something
when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself</i>, Gal. vi. 3. And
if faith be necessary to assurance, then it follows, as it is farther
observed in this answer, that they who have attained this
privilege, walk in all good conscience before God; whereby
the sincerity of their faith is evinced: Thus the apostle says,
<i>Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by
the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world</i>, 2
Cor. i. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We are now to consider the means by which assurance
is to be attained, <i>viz.</i> not by extraordinary revelation, but by
faith, founded on the promises of God. As to the former of
these, we have already considered, that assurance may be attained
without extraordinary revelation, as has been experienced
by some in this present dispensation of the gospel, in which
extraordinary revelation is ceased. And, indeed, it may be
observed, in the account the scripture gives of this privilege,
that it does not appear, that when extraordinary revelation was
granted to many, in the first age of the gospel, that the design
thereof was to lead men into the knowledge of their own state,
so as that they should attain assurance of their interest in Christ,
and right to eternal life that way. The main design of inspiration
was to qualify ministers in an extraordinary way to
preach the gospel, as the necessity of affairs seemed then to require
it; it was also necessary for the imparting some doctrines;
which could not otherwise be known: And, inasmuch as it
was an extraordinary dispensation of divine providence, it was
an expedient to give conviction to the world, concerning the
truth of the christian religion, since God hereby was pleased
to converse in an immediate way with men, and testified by
this, the great regard he had to his church, and answered the
great ends of inspiration, in propagating that religion which
was then to be set up in the world. But we do not find that
the work of grace was ordinarily wrought, or carried on this
way; nor was it God’s instituted means, without which they
could not attain assurance, which the saints’ arrived to, in that
age of extraordinary inspiration, the same way as we are to expect
to attain it. It is true, God has occasionally intimated,
by immediate revelation, that he would save some particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>persons, and that their <i>names were written in the book of life</i>,
Phil. iv. 3. but this was a special and extraordinary instance
of divine condescension, that some should be described by
name, in scripture, who had obtained this privilege; though
it is not designed hereby that others should expect to attain it
this way; and therefore it will be hard to prove that the apostle
Paul, and others whom he speaks of, who were assured of
their salvation, though they received the knowledge of other
things by inspiration, were led into the knowledge of their own
state in such a way, much less may we expect to attain assurance
by extraordinary revelation. And this leads us to consider
the ordinary means whereby we may attain it, which is,
in this answer, said to be, by faith, grounded on the truth of
God’s promises, and the Spirit’s testimony, whereby we are
enabled to discern in ourselves those graces which accompany
salvation; accordingly we must consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That in order to our arriving to a comfortable persuasion
that we shall be saved, there must be promises of life and salvation
revealed, which are contained in the gospel; these are
remotely necessary thereunto; for without a promise of salvation
we can have no hope of it; but notwithstanding these promises
are contained therein, yet many are destitute of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is also necessary, in order to our attaining assurance,
that there should be some marks and evidences revealed in the
word of God, as a rule for persons to try themselves by, in order
to their knowing that they are in a state of grace. Now
we may say concerning this, as well as the former, to wit, the
promises of salvation recorded, that though it be necessary to
assurance; yet it is only an objective means for our attaining
it, inasmuch as we are hereby led to see what graces experienced,
or duties performed by us, have the promise of salvation
annexed to them; and therefore let me add,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That it is necessary that we should discern in ourselves
those marks and evidences of grace to which the promise of
salvation is annexed; otherwise we have no right to lay claim
to it; accordingly it is our duty to look into ourselves, and observe
what marks of grace we have, from whence we may, by
the Spirit’s testimony with ours, discern ourselves to be in a
state of grace; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That in order to our attaining assurance, we must exercise
the duty of self-examination.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) What we may truly call a mark or evidence of grace,
whereby we may discern that we are in a state of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Notwithstanding this we are to depend on, hope, and
pray for, the testimony of the Spirit with our spirits, that we
are the children of God, and that these evidences are found
in us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>(1.) In order to our attaining assurance, it is necessary that
we exercise the duty of self-examination, which is God’s ordinance
for this end. And in order hereunto, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That it is certainly a duty and privilege for us to know
ourselves, not only what we do, but what we are; for without
this, whatever knowledge we may have of other things, we are
chargeable with great ignorance in a matter of the highest importance;
neither can we be sufficiently humble for those sins
we commit, or thankful for the mercies we receive. If we reckon
it an advantage to know what is done in the world, and are
very inquisitive into the affairs of others, it is much more necessary
and reasonable for us to endeavour to know what more
immediately relates to ourselves; or if we are very desirous to
know those things that concern our natural or civil affairs in the
world; whether we are in prosperous or adverse circumstances
therein, ought we not much more to enquire, how matters
stand with us, as to what concerns a better world?</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We cannot know the state of our souls, without impartial
self-examination. This is evident from the nature of the
thing. As enquiry is the means for our attaining knowledge;
so looking into ourselves is a means of attaining self-acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Self-examination is a duty founded on a divine command,
and an ordinance appointed for our attaining the knowledge of
our state. Thus the apostle says, <i>Examine yourselves, whether
ye be in the faith; prove your ownselves</i>, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. and
whatever duty God has commanded us to engage in, as expecting
any spiritual privilege to attend it, that is properly an ordinance
for the attaining that privilege; and if so, then it is an
argument to enforce the performance of that duty. Having
therefore proved self-examination to be a christian’s duty, we
shall now consider how it ought to be performed. And here
let it be observed, that as it is God’s ordinance, we are to have
a due regard to his presence, and consider him as an heart
searching God, and depend on his assistance, without which it
cannot be performed to any great advantage; but more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We are to engage in this duty deliberately. It cannot
well be performed while we are in an hurry of business. As
every thing is beautiful in its seasons, so time ought to be redeemed,
and we to retire from the world, to apply ourselves
to this as well as other secret duties, and the rather, because a
rash and hasty judgment concerning any thing, is generally
faulty, and must be reckoned an argument of weakness in him
that passes it, and it will be much more so when the thing to
be determined is of such vast importance.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span><i>2dly</i>, It ought to be done frequently; not like those things
which are to be performed but once in our lives, or only upon
some extraordinary occasions, but often, at least, so often, that
no presumptuous sin may be committed, nor any extraordinary
judgment inflicted on us, or mercy vouchsafed to us, without
a due observation thereof, in order to our improving them
aright to the glory of God, and our own edification: Nevertheless,
we cannot exactly determine what relates to the frequency
of this duty, any more than we can prescribe to those
who are in a way of trade and business in the world, how often
they are to cast up their accounts, and set their books in
order, that they may judge whether they go forward or backward
in the world: Notwithstanding, as the neglect hereof has
been detrimental to many, as to their worldly affairs; so the
neglect of self-examination has been often found an hindrance
to our comfortable procedure in our christian course: However,
so far as we may advise concerning the frequency of this
duty, it would redound much to the glory of God and our own
advantage, if, at the close of every day, we would call to mind
the experiences we have had, and observe the frame of spirit
with which we have engaged in all the business thereof. This
the Psalmist advises when he says, <i>Commune with your own
heart upon your bed, and be still</i>, Psal. iv. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is adviseable for us to perform this duty whenever
we engage in other solemn stated religious duties, whether
public or private, that we may know what matter we have
for prayer, or praise, what help we want from God, against the
prevalency of corruption or temptation, or what answers of
prayer we have received from him, or what success we have
had under any ordinance, in which we have engaged, as well
as what the present frame of our spirit is, when drawing nigh
to God in any holy duty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, It ought to be performed with great diligence, inasmuch
as it is no easy matter to arrive to such a knowledge of
ourselves, and the secret working of our hearts and affections,
in what respects things divine and heavenly, or to discern the
truth of grace, so as not to mistake that for a saving work,
which has only the external shew of godliness, without the power
of it; this requires great diligence and industry to know:
Accordingly the Psalmist, in speaking concerning the performance
of this duty, says, <i>I commune with mine own heart, and
my spirit made diligent search</i>, Psal. lxxvii. 6. The thing to
be enquired into is not barely, whether we are sinners in general,
or exposed to many miseries in this life, as the consequence
thereof? for this is sufficiently evident by daily experience.
But we are to endeavour after a more particular knowledge
of ourselves, and accordingly are to enquire; whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>sin hath dominion over us to such a degree, so that all the
powers and faculties of our souls are enslaved thereby, and we
commit sin in such a way, as denominates us, as our Saviour
expresses it, <i>servants of sin</i>? John viii. 34. or, whether sin be
loathed and abhorred, avoided and repented of? and as to our
state, we are to enquire; whether we have ground to conclude
that we are justified, and thereby delivered from the guilt of
sin, and the condemning sentence of the law? or, whether we
remain in a state of condemnation, and the wrath of God abideth
on us? We must enquire, whether the work of grace be
really begun, so that we are effectually called, and enabled to
put forth spiritual actions from a renewed nature? and whether
this work is going forward or declining? what is the strength
or weakness of our faith? Also we are to enquire, what is the
general tenor of our actions? whether the ends we design in
all religious duties are right and warrantable? whether our improvement
in grace bears any proportion to the means we are
favoured with?</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to examine ourselves; whether we perform
all those relative duties that are incumbent on us, so as
to glorify God in our conversation with men, whereby we endeavour
to do good to, and receive good from them, and accordingly
improve our talents to the glory of God, from whom
we received them? These and such like things are to be enquired
into, which will be more immediately subservient to the
attaining this privilege of assurance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Self-examination ought to be performed with the
greatest impartiality. Conscience, which is to act the part of a
judge and a witness, must be faithful in its dictates and determinations,
it being a matter of the greatest importance; and
therefore, in passing a judgment on our state, we must proceed
according to the rules of strict justice, not denying, on
the one hand, what we have received from God, or resolutely
concluding against ourselves, that there is no hope, when there
are many things that afford matter of peace and comfort to us;
nor, on the other hand, are we to think ourselves something
when we are nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore some are obliged to conclude, as the result of this
enquiry, into their state, that they are unregenerate and destitute
of the saving grace of God. This sentence persons are
obliged to pass on themselves, who are grossly ignorant, not
sensible of the plague of their own hearts, and altogether unacquainted
with the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, or the
method prescribed in the gospel, for the sinner’s justification
or freedom from the guilt of sin, in a fiducial application of
Christ’s righteousness, which is the only means conducive
thereunto; and who know not what is included in evangelical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>repentance; how sin is to be mortified, and what it is to depend
on Christ in the execution of his offices of prophet, priest,
and king, at least, if they have not such a degree of the knowledge
of these things, though they cannot fully and clearly describe
them, as may influence their practice, and excite those
graces, which all true converts are enabled to exercise, they
have ground to conclude that they are in a state of unregeneracy.
And to this we may add, that a person must conclude
against himself, that he is destitute of the grace of God, if he
allows himself in the omission of known duties, or the commission
of known sins, and is content with a form of godliness,
without the power thereof, or values and esteems the
praise of men more than of God; such must conclude that
their hearts are not right with him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, We must examine ourselves concerning our state,
with a resolution, by the grace of God, to make a right improvement
of that judgment which we are bound to pass on
ourselves. And therefore, if we apprehend that we are in a state
of unregeneracy, we are not to sink into despair; but to wait
on God in all his appointed means and ordinances, in order to
our obtaining the first grace, that, by the powerful influences
of the Spirit, there may be such a true change wrought in us,
that we may have ground to hope better things concerning ourselves,
even things which accompany salvation. And if we find
that we have experienced the grace of God in truth, we may
be disposed to give him all the glory; to exercise a continued
dependence on him, for what is still lacking to complete the
work, and as we have received Christ Jesus the Lord to walk
in him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, This duty must be performed with judgment; and
accordingly we are to compare our hearts and actions with the
rule which is prescribed in the word of God, whereby we may
know whether we have those marks and evidences of grace,
from whence we may conclude, that we have a good foundation
to build on, and that our hope is such, as shall never make
ashamed; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) What we may truly call a mark or evidence of grace,
whereby we may discern that we are in a state of salvation.
In order to our understanding this, we must consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That every thing, which is a mark or evidence of a thing,
must be more known than that which is designed to be evinced
thereby. The sign must always be more known than the
thing signified by it; inasmuch as it is a means of our knowing
that which we are at present in doubt about. As when the
finger is placed in a cross-road, to direct the traveller which
way he is to take.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. A mark or evidence of a thing must contain some essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>property of that which it is designed to evince: thus the
inferring consequences from premises is an essential property
belonging to every intelligent creature, and to none else; therefore
it is a mark or evidence thereof; so to design the best
end, and use those means that are conducive thereunto, is an
essential property of a wise man, and consequently a mark or
evidence of wisdom. And, on the other hand, there are some
things, which are not essential properties, but accidental, as an
healthful constitution is to man, or a particular action, that has
some appearance of wisdom and goodness, but not all the necessary
ingredients thereof, to a wise or good man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to apply these rules to our present purpose, in determining
what we may call marks or evidences of grace. With
respect to the former of them, <i>viz.</i> that a mark must be more
known than the thing that is evinced thereby; we may conclude,
that eternal election, or the Spirit’s implanting a principle
of grace in regeneration, cannot be said to be marks or
evidences of sanctification, since these are less known than the
thing designed to be evinced thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as to the other rule, <i>viz.</i> that a mark must contain an
essential property of that which it evinces: it follows from
hence, that our engaging in holy duties, without the exercise
of grace therein; or our extending charity to the poor, when
it does not proceed from faith or love to God, &amp;c. is no certain
evidence of the truth of grace, since a person may perform
these duties and yet be destitute hereof; whereas, that which
is essential to a thing, is inseparable from it. Thus concerning
marks of grace in general; which I could not but think necessary
to premise, inasmuch as some have entertained prejudices
against all marks of grace, and seem to assert, that a believer
is not to judge of his state thereby; than which, nothing seems
more absurd. If they who are thus prejudiced against them,
have nothing to say in defence thereof, but that some assign
those things to be marks of grace which are not so, and thereby
lead themselves and others, into mistakes about them; what
has been premised concerning the nature of a mark, or evidence,
may, in some measure, fence against this prejudice, as
well as prepare our way for what may be said concerning them.
Therefore we shall, <i>First</i>, consider those things which can
hardly be reckoned marks of grace; and, <i>Secondly</i>, what marks
we may judge of ourselves by.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, As to the former of these, what are not to be reckoned
marks of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We are not to conclude that a person is in a state of grace,
barely because he has a strong impression on his own spirit that
he is so; since that is accidental, and not essential to grace,
and many are mistaken with respect to this matter. It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>to be doubted, but they whom our Saviour represents as saying,
<i>Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in
thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful
works</i>, Matt. vii. 2. had a strong persuasion founded
on this evidence, that they were in a state of grace, till they
found themselves mistaken, when he commanded them to <i>depart
from him</i>? Nothing is more obvious than that many presume
they are something when they are nothing; and, indeed,
a persuasion that a person is in a state of grace, barely because
he cannot think otherwise of himself, the thing being impressed
on his spirit, without any other evidence, lays such an one too
open to the charge of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. An external profession of religion, discovered in the performance
of several holy duties, is no certain sign of the truth
of grace; for this many make who are not effectually called.
Of such as these Christ speaks, when he says, <i>Many are called,
but few are chosen</i>, Matt. xx. 16. And to this we may add,
that persons may have some degree of raised affections, when
attending on the ordinances, some sudden flashes of joy, when
they hear of the privileges of believers, both in this and a better
world; though their conversation be not agreeable to their
confident and presumptuous expectation thereof. And, on the
other hand, some have their fears very much awakened under
the ordinances, as the subject of their meditations has a tendency
thereunto; others have such a degree of sorrow, that it
gives vent to itself in a flood of tears; as Esau is said to have
<i>sought the blessing with tears</i>, Heb. xii. 17. but yet there is
something else wanting to evince the truth of grace. I do not
deny but that it is a great blessing to have raised affections in
holy duties; but when this is only in particular instances, and
they are principally excited by some external motives or circumstances
attending the ordinance they are engaged in; and
when the impressions made on them, wear off as soon as the
ordinance is over, in this case we can hardly determine a person
to be in a state of grace hereby. The affections, indeed,
are warmed in holy duties; but this is like an iron heated in
the fire, which, when taken out, soon grows cold again; and
not like that natural heat that remains in the body of man,
which is an abiding sign of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since this subject is to be treated on with the utmost
caution, inasmuch as many are apt to conclude, that they have
no grace, because they have no raised affections, in holy duties, as
well as others presume they have grace merely because they are
affected therein, let it be farther considered; that when we speak
of raised affections, not being a certain mark of grace, we consider
them as being destitute of those other evidences, which
contain some essential properties of grace: the affections are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>often raised by insignificant sounds, or by the tone of the voice,
when there is nothing in the matter delivered, that is adapted
to excite any grace, the judgment is not informed thereby, nor
the will persuaded to embrace Christ, as offered in the gospel.
There may be transports of joy in hearing the word, when, at
the same time, corrupt nature retains its opposition to the spirituality
thereof. A person may conceive the greatest pleasure
in an ungrounded hope of heaven, as a state of freedom from
the miseries of this life, when he has no savour or relish of that
holiness which is its glory, in which respect his conversation is
not in heaven; and he may be very much terrified with the
wrath of God, and the punishment of sin in hell; when, at the
same time, there is not a due sense of the vile and odious nature
of sin, or an abhorrence of it: such instances of raised
affections we intend when we speak of them as no marks or
evidences of the truth of grace. But, on the other hand, when,
together with raised affections, there is the exercise of suitable
graces, and the impression thereof remains, when their fervency
is abated or lost, this is a good sign of grace; whereas, when
they are not accompanied with the exercise of any grace, they
afford no mark or evidence of the truth thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we may not be mistaken as to this matter, let us
enquire, not only what it is that has a tendency to raise the
affections; but whether our understandings are rightly informed
in the doctrines of the gospel, and our wills choose and
embrace what is revealed therein. And if we find it a difficult
matter for our affections to be raised in holy duties, let us farther
enquire, whether this may not proceed from our natural
constitution? and if the passions are not easily moved with any
other things in the common affairs of life; we have then no reason
to conclude that our being destitute hereof in the exercise
of holy duties, is a sign that we have not the truth of grace, especially
if Christ and divine things are the objects of our settled
choice, and our hearts are fixed trusting in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The performance of those moral duties, which are materially
good, is no certain sign of the truth of grace; I do not
say that this is not necessary; for when we speak of a mark
of grace, as containing in it what is essential thereunto, we distinguish
between that which is a necessary pre-requisite, without
which, none can have grace; and that which is an essential
ingredient in it. Where there is no morality, there is certainly
no grace; but if there be nothing more than this, there
is an essential ingredient wanting, by which this matter must
be determined. A person may abstain from gross enormities,
such as murder, adultery, theft, reviling, extortion, covetousness,
&amp;c. and, in many respects, perform the contrary duties,
and yet be destitute of faith in Christ. The Pharisee, whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>our Saviour mentions in the gospel, had as much to say on this
subject as any one; yet his heart was not right with God; nor
was his boasting hereof approved of by Christ. There are multitudes
who perform many religious duties, when it comports
with their secular interests; they adhere to Christ in a time of
prosperity; but in a time of adversity they fall from him; and
then, that which seemed to be most excellent in them is lost,
and then they appear to be, what they always were, destitute
of the truth of grace. We now proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, What are those marks by which persons may safely
conclude themselves to be in a state of grace. In order to
our determining this matter, we must consider what are the
true and genuine effects of faith, which we find mentioned in
scripture, namely, those other graces that accompany or flow
from it; as when it is said to <i>work by love</i>, Gal. v. 6. or as we
are hereby enabled to <i>overcome the world</i>, 1 John v. 4. or to
despise the honours, riches, and pleasures thereof; especially
when standing in competition with Christ; or our hearts are
thereby drawn aside from him: this effect it produced in Moses,
when he <i>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than
to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach
of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt</i>,
Heb. xi. 24-26. and in others, who <i>confessed that they were
strangers and pilgrims on the earth</i>, ver. 13, 16. who <i>desired a
better country</i>, that is, <i>an heavenly</i>; whose <i>conversation was in
heaven</i>, Phil. iii. 10. Moreover, we are to enquire whether it
has a tendency to <i>purify the heart</i>, Acts xv. 9. and so puts us
upon abhorring, flying from, watching, and striving against
every thing that tends to corrupt and defile the soul! and
whether it tends to excite us to universal obedience, which is
called <i>the obedience of faith</i>, Rom. xvi. 26. and a carefulness to
<i>maintain good works</i>, Tit. iii. 6. which proceed from, and are
evidences of the truth of it? as the apostle says, <i>Shew me thy
faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my
works</i>, James ii. 18. or, as our Saviour says, <i>The tree is known
by his fruit</i>. But that we may more particularly judge of the
truth of grace by the marks and evidences thereof, we must
consider its beginning and progress, or with what frame of spirit
we first embraced and closed with Christ; and what our
conversation has been since that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the former of these, to wit, our judging of the truth
of grace by the first beginning thereof. Here we are to enquire,
what were the motives and inducements that inclined us
to accept of Christ? Did we first see ourselves lost and undone,
as sinful, fallen creatures; and were we determined hereupon
to have recourse to him for salvation, as the only refuge we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>could betake ourselves to? Did we first consider ourselves as
guilty; and did this guilt set very uneasy upon us; and in order
to the removal of it, did we betake ourselves to Christ for
forgiveness? and did we consider ourselves as weak and unable
to do what is good, and so apply ourselves to him for
strength against indwelling sin, and victory over the temptations
which prevailed against us?</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, let us enquire, whether it was only a slavish fear
and dread of the wrath of God, and the punishment of sin in
hell, that gave the first turn to our thoughts and affections, so
as to put us on altering our course of life? or, whether, besides
this, we saw the evil of sin arising from its intrinsic nature,
and its opposition to the holiness of God; and was this
attended with shame and self-abhorrence? and, at the same
time, did we see the excellency and loveliness of Christ? was
he <i>precious</i> to us <i>as he is to them that believe</i>? 1 Pet. ii. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, let us farther enquire, what were the workings of our
spirits when we first closed with Christ? did we do this with
judgment, duly weighing what he demands of us in a way of
duty, as well as what we are encouraged to expect from him?
were we made willing to accept of him in all his offices, and to
have respect to all his commandments? were we earnestly desirous
to have communion with him here, as well as to be glorified
with him hereafter? were we content to submit to the
cross of Christ, to bear his reproach, and to count this preferable
to all the glories of the world? were we willing to be conformed
to an humbled suffering Jesus, and to take our lot with
his servants, though they may be reckoned the refuse and off-scouring
of all things? And let us farther enquire; whether
we did this with reliance on his assistance, as being sensible
of the treachery and deceitfulness of our own hearts, and our
utter inability to do what is good, without the aids of his grace?
did we accordingly give up ourselves to him in hope of obtaining
help from him, in order to the right discharge of every duty?
did we reckon ourselves nothing, and Christ to be all in all,
that all our springs are in him? This was a good beginning of
the work of grace, which will prepare the way for this grace
of assurance, which we are now considering.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> Some will object against what has been said concerning
our enquiring into, or being able to discern the first acts of
faith, or that frame of spirit wherewith we then closed with
Christ, that they know not the time of their conversion, if ever
they were converted; they cannot remember or determine
what was the particular ordinance or providence, that gave
them the first conviction of sin, and of their need of Christ,
and induced them to close with him; much less can they tell
what were the workings of their hearts at such a time: It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>impossible for them to trace the footsteps of providence, so as
to point out the way and manner in which this work was at
first begun in their souls. This therefore is not to be laid down
as a mark or evidence of grace, which so few can make use of.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> I am not insensible that this is the case of the greatest
number of believers. There are very few, who, like the apostle
Paul, can tell the time and place of their conversion, and
every circumstance leading to it; or like those converts, who,
when the gospel was first preached by Peter, <i>were pricked in
their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles,
Men and brethren, what shall we do?</i> Acts ii. 37. or like the
jailor, who broke forth into an affectionate enquiry, not much
unlike to it; <i>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</i> chap. xvi. 30.
though the ordinance leading to it was of a different nature.
Sometimes, the way of the Spirit of God in the soul at first, is
so discernable, that it cannot but be observed by them who are
brought into a state of grace; but others know nothing of this,
especially they who have not run into all excess of riot, and been
stopped in their course on a sudden, by the grace of God; in
whom the change made in conversion, was real, though it could
not, from the nature of the thing be so plainly discerned in all
its circumstances. Some have been regenerate from the womb;
others have had a great degree of restraining grace, and been
trained up in the knowledge of the doctrines of the gospel from
their very childhood, and retain the impressions of a religious
education; these cannot so easily discern the first beginnings
of the work of grace in their souls; yet they may, and ought
to enquire, whether ever they found, in the course of their lives,
such a frame of spirit as has been before described, which believers
have when the work of grace is first begun, and it is
not very material for them to be able to discern whether these
were the first actings of grace or no? The main thing to be
determined is; whether they have ground to conclude, that
ever they experienced the grace of God in truth? In this case,
the most that some can say concerning themselves, is as the
blind man says in the gospel, when the Pharisees were inquisitive
about the restoring his sight, and the way and manner in
which this was done; this is all that I know concerning myself,
that <i>whereas I was blind, now I see</i>, John ix. 25. so the
true convert says; whereas I was once dead in trespasses and
sins, I am now alive, and enabled to put forth living and spiritual
actions, to the glory of God. This evidence will give
as much ground to conclude that they are in a state of grace,
as though they were able to determine when they were first
brought into it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We may judge of the truth of grace by the method in
which it has been carried on, whether we are able to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the way and manner in which it was first begun, or no, as a
farther evidence of the truth thereof. Sanctification is a progressive
work; therefore it is not enough for us to set our faces
heaven-ward; but we must make advances towards it, and
be found in the daily exercise of grace, in order to our concluding
that we are in a state of grace. A believer must not
only set out in the right way, but he must hold on therein; he
must live by faith if he would conclude that the work of faith
is begun in truth. It is not sufficient to call upon God, or implore
help from him, when under some distressing providences,
and afterwards to grow remiss in, or lay aside this duty;
but it must be our constant work. A true christian is distinguished
from an hypocrite, in that it is said, concerning the
latter, <i>Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always
call upon God?</i> Job xxvii. 20. denoting that a true believer
will do so. He is either habitually or actually inclined to it;
and that in such a way as is attended with the daily exercise
of those graces, which are the fruits and effects of faith, whereby
he may conclude that he is in a state of grace. Thus far
we have considered those marks or evidences of grace, which,
in order to our attaining assurance, we must be able to discern
in ourselves. But inasmuch as a believer may understand what
are the marks of grace contained in scripture, and, at the same
time, enquire into the state of his soul, to know whether he can
apprehend in himself any evidences of the truth of grace; and
not be able to arrive to a satisfaction as to this matter, so as
to have his doubts and fears removed; let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That he must depend on, hope, and pray for the testimony
of the Spirit, with his spirit, that he is a child of God. It
will be a difficult matter for us to conclude that we have the
truth of grace, till the Spirit is pleased to shine on his own
work; which, when he does, all things will appear clear and
bright to us, though before this we might walk in darkness,
and have no light. In speaking concerning the inward testimony
of the Spirit (which is necessary to enable a believer to
discern in himself the marks of grace, on which his assurance
of salvation is founded) let it be premised; that as it is a branch
of the Spirit’s divine glory, by his internal influence, to deal
with the hearts of his people; so he does this various ways,
according to the various faculties of the soul, which are the
subjects thereof; particularly, when by his power, he renews
the will, and causes it to act those graces which are the effects
of his divine power; then he is said to sanctify a believer.
But when he deals with the understanding and conscience, enabling
us to discern the truth of the work of grace, that we
may take the comfort of it, then he is described, in scripture,
as a witness hereunto, or as witnessing with our spirits, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>we are in a state of grace, the consequence of which is, that
<i>the eyes of</i> our <i>understanding being enlightened</i>, we <i>may know
what is the hope of his calling</i>, Eph. i. 18. accordingly he gives
us to discern that he has called us by his grace; and, as the
result thereof, granted us a hope of eternal life.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a privilege plainly mentioned in scripture; and we
must not suppose that none had it but those who had extraordinary
revelation, since it is so necessary to a believer’s attaining
that peace and joy which the church, in this present dispensation,
is certainly not less possessed of, than it was in former
ages. And that the Spirit gives his testimony to the
work of grace in the souls of believers, though extraordinary
revelation be ceased, is evident from what is matter of daily
experience; since there are many instances of those who have
used their utmost endeavours in examining themselves, to know
whether they had any marks of grace, who have not been able
to discern any, though they have been thought to be sincere
believers by others, till, on a sudden, light has broke forth out
of darkness, and their evidences for eternal life cleared up, so
that all their doubts have been removed; and this they could
not but attribute to a divine hand, inasmuch as before this they
could meditate nothing but terror to themselves; and, in this
case, what the apostle prays for, with respect to the church,
<i>That the God of hope would fill them with all joy and peace in believing,
that they might abound in hope, through the power of
the Holy Ghost</i>, Rom. xv. 13. is experienced by them: And
on this account they are said, to be <i>sealed with that Holy Spirit
of promise</i>, Eph. i. 13. whereby their hope is established,
and that is now confirmed to them by this means, which they
were before in perplexity about; so that we have as much
ground to conclude that the Spirit is the author of assurance
in believers, as we have that he is the author of sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that this doctrine may not appear liable to the charge
of enthusiasm, let it be farther considered, that the Spirit never
gives his testimony to the truth of grace in any, in whom he
has not first wrought it; for that would be, as it were, a setting
his seal to a blank. And to this we may add, that he, at
the same time, excites the lively exercise of grace, whereby
they are enabled to discern that it is true and genuine; so that
their assurance, though it be not without some internal, impressive
influences, which they are favoured with; yet it is
not wholly dependent on them: Therefore, if you demand a
reason of the hope that is in them, though they ascribe the glory
hereof to the Holy Spirit, as enabling them to discern the
truth of grace; yet they are able to prove their ownselves, after
having examined themselves, whether they are in the faith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>by discovering their evidences of the faith of God’s elect;
which argues that their assurance is no delusion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. LXXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXI.</span> <i>Are all true believers, at all times, assured
of their present being in the estate of grace; and that they
shall be saved?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence
of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain
it; and after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened
and intermitted through manifold distempers, sins,
temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without
such a presence and support of the Spirit of God, as keeps
them from sinking into utter despair.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having considered some believers as favoured with assurance
of their being in a state of grace, we are, in this
answer, led to speak of others who are destitute of it. And
the general method in which it may be considered, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That there is something supposed, namely, that assurance
of grace and salvation is not of the essence of saving faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Some things are inferred from this supposition, namely,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That true believers may wait long before they obtain assurance.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That after the enjoyment thereof it may be weakened and
intermitted; the reasons whereof are assigned, <i>viz.</i> bodily distempers,
sins, temptations, and divine desertions; yet it is farther
added, that they are never left without the support of the
Spirit of God; whereby they are kept from sinking into utter
despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. As to the thing supposed in this answer, <i>viz.</i> that assurance
of grace and salvation is not of the essence of faith.
There are many who, in other respects, explain the nature of
faith, in such a way as is unexceptionable, who, notwithstanding,
assert that assurance is of the essence thereof; in which
we cannot but think they express themselves very unwarily, at
least, they ought to have more clearly discovered what they
mean by faith, and what by assurance, being of the essence of
faith; if they mean that no one has saving faith but he who
has an assurance of his own salvation; they not only assert
what is contrary to the experience of many believers, but lay a
stumbling-block in the way of weak Christians, who will be
induced from hence to conclude, that because they cannot tell
whether they are true believers or no, therefore they are destitute
of saving faith; upon which account it is necessary for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>us to enquire how far this supposition is to be allowed of, and
in what respect denied.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certain, that there are many excellent divines, in our
own and foreign nations, who have defined faith by assurance;
which they have supposed so essential to it, that without it no
one can be reckoned a believer. It may be they might be inclined
thus to express themselves by the sense in which they
understood several texts of scripture, in which assurance seems
to be considered as a necessary ingredient in faith; as it is said,
<i>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith</i>,
Heb. x. 22. and when the apostle speaks of assurance, as a
privilege that belonged to the church to which he wrote, <i>We
know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens</i>, 2 Cor. v. 1. and elsewhere, he so far blames
their not knowing themselves, or being destitute of this assurance,
that he will hardly allow them to have any faith, who
were without it; <i>Know ye not your ownselves, how that Jesus,
Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates</i>, chap. xiii. 5. From
such like expressions as these, they who plead for assurance
being of the essence of faith, are ready to conclude, that they
who are destitute of it, can hardly be called believers.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, that this matter may be set in a true light, we must distinguish
between assurance of the object, <i>viz.</i> the great and
important doctrines of the gospel, being of the essence of faith;
and assurance of our interest in Christ being so. The former
of these we will not deny; for no one can come to Christ, who
is not assured that he will receive him, nor trust in him till
he is fully assured that he is able to save him: but the latter
we must take leave to deny; for if no one is a believer but he
that knows himself to be so, then he that doubts of his salvation,
must be concluded to be no believer; which is certainly
a very discouraging doctrine to weak Christians. And also,
when we lose the comfortable persuasion we once had, of our
interest in Christ, we are bound to question all our former experiences,
and to determine ourselves to be in a state of unregeneracy,
which is, in effect to deny to give God the glory of
that powerful work which was formerly wrought in us, which
we then thought to be a work of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>If they, indeed, mean by assurance, being of the essence of
faith, that an assurance of our interest in Christ is essential to
the highest or most comfortable acts of faith, designing thereby
to put us upon pressing after it, if we have not attained to
it; and that hereby God is very much glorified, and a foundation
laid for our offering praise to him, for the experience we
have had of his grace, which a doubting Christian cannot be
said to do; we have nothing to say against it. Or, if they should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>assert, that doubting is no ingredient in faith, nor a commendable
excellency in a Christian; this we do not deny. All that
we are contending for is, that there may be a direct act of faith,
or a faith of reliance, in those who are destitute of assurance
that they are in a state of grace; which is the thing supposed
in this answer, when it is said, that assurance is not of the essence
of faith. That this may be better understood, and we be
led into the sense of those scriptures that describe believers as
having assurance, such as those but now mentioned, and others
to the like purpose, let it be considered, that there are many
scriptures, in which believers are said to have such an assurance,
as only respects the objects of faith, <i>viz.</i> the person, offices,
and glory of Christ, the truth of the gospel, and the promises
thereof; which we do not deny to be of the essence of
faith. Thus, when the apostle prays for the church, <i>That their
hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto
all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment
of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ</i>,
Col. ii. 2. and when elsewhere he says, <i>Our gospel came to you
in much assurance</i>, 1 Thess, i. 5. and when he exhorts persons
to <i>draw near</i> to God, <i>with a true heart, in full assurance of
faith</i>, Heb. x. 22. it is probable, that he means in these, and
several other scriptures of the like import, no more than an
assurance of the object of faith. And as for that scripture but
now mentioned, in 2 Cor. xiii. 5. where he seems to assert, that
all who are destitute of this privilege are reprobates; some understand
the word, which we translate <i>reprobates</i>, as only signifying
injudicious Christians; and if so, this is not inconsistent
with the character of believers: but others, with an equal
degree of probability, render it <i>disapproved</i>;<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> and so the meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>is, that if you know not your ownselves, to wit, that Christ
is in you, you are greatly to be blamed, or disapproved; especially
because this proceeds from your neglect of the duty of
self-examination; by which means you have no proof of Christ’s
being in you, who are so ready to demand a proof of his speaking
in his ministers, as in verse 3. Therefore it does not appear
from this text, that every one who endeavours to know that he
is in a state of grace, by diligent self-examination, but cannot
conclude that he is so, must be determined to be destitute of
faith; which would necessarily follow from our asserting that
assurance of our interest in Christ, is of the essence of saving
faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other scriptures which speak of assurance as a distinguishing
character of Christians in general; which are usually
brought to prove, that assurance is of the essence of faith,
<i>viz.</i> 2 Cor. v. 1. <i>We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens</i>; and, 1 John v. 19. <i>we
know that we are of God</i>: and in several places in the New
Testament, in which the apostle addresses his discourse to
whole churches, as having assurance, as well as the grace of
faith: thus the apostle Peter, 1 Pet. i. 8, 9. speaks of them as
<i>loving Christ, believing in him, rejoicing with joy unspeakable
and full of glory, and receiving the end of their faith, even the
salvation of their soul</i>; which could hardly be said of them, if
they were destitute of assurance of their own salvation. All
that I would infer from these and such-like scriptures is, that
it seems probable that assurance was a privilege more commonly
experienced in that age of the church than it is in our
day; and there may be two reasons assigned for this,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Because the change that passed upon them, when they
were converted, was so apparent, that it was hardly possible for
it not to be discerned. They turned from dead idols, and the
practice of the vilest abominations, to serve the living God;
which two extremes are so opposite, that their being brought
from one to the other could not but be remarked by, and consequently
more visible to themselves, than if it had been otherwise;
but,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That which may be assigned as the principal reason of
this is, because the church was called, at this time, to bear a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>public testimony to the gospel, by enduring persecutions of
various kinds; and some of them were to resist unto blood.
Therefore, that God might prepare them for these sufferings,
and that he might encourage others to embrace the faith of the
gospel, which was then in its infant state, he was pleased to favour
them with this great privilege. And it may be hereafter,
if God should call the church to endure like trials, he may in
mercy grant them a greater degree of assurance than is ordinarily
experienced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, it may be questioned; whether those scriptures
which speak of assurance, as though it were a privilege
common to the whole church, are not to be understood as applicable
to the greater part of them, rather than to every individual
believer among them. For though the apostle, in one of
the scriptures before-mentioned, considers the church at Corinth,
as enjoying this privilege, and concluding that it should
go well with them in another world, when this earthly tabernacle
was dissolved; yet he speaks of some of them, in the same
epistle, as not knowing their ownselves, how that Jesus Christ
was in them. And the apostle John, notwithstanding what he
says to the church, <i>We knew that we are of God</i>, in 1 John v.
19. which argues that many of them had assurance, plainly intimates
that all had it not, from what he says, ver. 13. <i>These
things have I written unto you, that believe on the name of the
Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life</i>: and
though in another scripture, but now mentioned, the apostle
Peter speaks to the church to which he writes, as having <i>joy
unspeakable and full of glory</i> consequent upon their faith,
which argues that they had assurance; yet he exhorts others
of them <i>to give diligence to make their calling and election sure</i>,
2 Pet. i. 10. these therefore are supposed, at that time, not to
have it: from all which it may be concluded, that assurance of
grace and salvation, is not of the essence of saving faith; which
is the thing supposed in this answer.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>II. We proceed to consider those things that are inferred
from this supposition, viz.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That a believer may wait long before he attains it: this
appears from what is matter of daily experience and observation.
The sovereignty of God discovers itself herein, as much
as it does when he makes the ordinances effectual to salvation,
in giving converting grace unto those who attend upon them.
Some are called early to be made partakers of that salvation
that is in Christ, others late. The same may be said with respect
to God’s giving assurance. Some are favoured with this
privilege soon after, or when first they believe; others are like
those whom the apostle speaks of, <i>who, through fear of death,
are all their life-time subject to bondage</i>, Heb. ii. 15. Many have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>often enquired into the state of their souls, that cannot discern
any marks or evidences of grace in themselves; whose conversation
is such, that others cannot but conclude them to be
true believers; their spirits are deprest, doubts and fears prevail,
and tend to make their lives very uncomfortable; they
wait and pray for the evidence and sense of God’s love to them,
but cannot immediately find it: this the Psalmist speaks of,
either in his own person, or thereby represents the case of many
who had the truth of grace, but not the assurance thereof, when
he says, <i>O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night
before thee; I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up;
while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted</i>, Psal. lxxxviii. compared
with the xv. God suffers it to be thus with them for wise
ends. Hereby he lets them know, that assurance of his love is
a special gift and work of the Spirit; without which they remain
destitute of it, and cannot take comfort, either from their
former or present experiences.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They who once enjoyed assurance, may have it weakened
and intermitted; whether it may be entirely lost will be considered
under a following head, when we speak concerning the
supports that believers have, and how far they are kept hereby
from sinking into utter despair: it is one thing to fall from the
truth of grace, another thing to lose the comfortable sense thereof.
The joy of faith may be suspended, when the acts and habits
of faith remain firm and unshaken. The brightest morning
may afterwards be followed with clouds and tempests; even
so our clearest discoveries of our interest in the love of God
may be followed with the withdrawment of the light of his
countenance, and we be left under many discouraging circumstances
concerning our state, having lost the assurance we
once had.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be inquired, what reason may be assigned for this? I
answer, that it must, in a great measure, be resolved into the
sovereignty of God, who will bring his people which way he
pleases, to heaven; and may take those comforts which had
their first rise from himself; and, at the same time, none must
say, why dost thou thus? However, we may observe some particular
reasons, which the providence of God points out to us,
to which we may in other respects, ascribe our want of assurance;
and these may be reduced to four heads, particularly
mentioned in this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is sometimes occasioned by manifold distempers, or
bodily diseases: the soul and body are so closely joined to,
and dependant on each other, that the one can hardly suffer
without the other. Hence it is that bodily distempers affect
the mind, excite and give disturbance to the passions; which
is a great addition to the uneasiness that ensues hereupon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>When the spirits are deprest, and we are under the prevalency
of a melancholy disposition, we are oftentimes inclined to think
that we are not in a state of grace; and though we were before
this disposed to comfort others in like cases, we are at this time
unable to take the least encouragement ourselves. All things
look black and dismal; our former hope is reckoned no other
than delusive, and we brought to the very brink of despair.
And it may be observed, that these sad and melancholy apprehensions
concerning our state, increase or abate, as the distemper
that gives occasion thereunto more or less prevails.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we may be able to determine whether our want
of assurance proceeds from some natural cause or bodily distemper,
we must enquire; whether, before this, we have endeavoured
to walk in all good conscience in the sight of God?
to hate every false way, and make religion the great business
of life, so that we cannot assign any reigning sin as the cause
of our present desponding frame? And also, whether we have
been diligent in performing the duty of self-examination, and
have been sensible that we stood in need of the Spirit’s witness
with ours, in order to our arriving to a comfortable persuasion
that we are in a state of grace? And if, as the result of these
enquiries, we cannot see any cause leading to this dejection of
spirit, but the unavoidable infirmities, which we are daily liable
to, then we may probably conclude, that it arises from a distemper
of body. And, in order to our determining this matter,
we must farther inquire; whether some afflictive providence
has not had an influence upon us, to bring us into a melancholy
temper? and whether this does not appear in what relates to
our secular, as well as our spiritual concerns? and if this be
the case, though it be very afflictive, it is not attended with
that guilt as it would be, had it been occasioned by some presumptuous
sin; and there are other medicines to be used when
it arises from this cause, besides those which are of a spiritual
nature, that are contained in the gospel; but what they are, it
is not our business, in this place, to determine.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are many sins which are the occasion of a person’s
being destitute of assurance. As all the troubles of life
are brought upon us by sin; so are all our doubts and fears,
arising from the want of a comfortable sense of, or interest in,
the love of God. It pleases God, in the method of his providence,
thus to deal with his people, that he may humble them
for presumptuous sins; more especially those that are committed
against light and conviction of conscience, that he may
bring to remembrance their sins of omission, or neglect to exercise
those graces in which the life of faith consists, that hereby
they may feel the effect of their stupidity, indifferency, and carnal
security, or their engaging in religious duties, in their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>strength, without dependence on the Spirit and grace of God,
or a due sense of their inability to perform any duty in a right
way. Or, sometimes, as has been before observed, they want
assurance, because they do not examine themselves, which is
God’s ordinance for the attaining this privilege; or, if they do,
they neglect to give that glory to the Holy Spirit which is due
to him, by depending on his enlightening influence, whereby
they may arrive to a comfortable persuasion of their interest
in Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Assurance is oftentimes weakened and intermitted
through manifold temptations. Satan is very active in this
matter, and shews his enmity against the interest of Christ in
the souls of his people, as much as lies in his power, with this
intent, that though it is impossible for him to ruin the soul, by
rooting out that grace that is implanted in it; yet he may disturb
its peace, and weaken its assurance, and, if not prevented,
hurry it into despair. In this case the general design of his
temptations is to represent God as a sin-revenging Judge, a
consuming fire, and to present to our view, the threatenings
whereby his wrath is revealed against sinners; and to endeavour
to set aside the promises of the gospel, from which alone
relief may be had.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, he puts us upon considering sin, not only as
heinously aggravated, (which may, for the most part be done
with justice) but also as altogether unpardonable; and, at the
same time pretends to insinuate to us that we are not elected,
or that Christ did not die for us; and therefore, what he has
done and suffered will not redound to our advantage. Now
there is apparently the hand of Satan in this matter; inasmuch
as he attempts, by false methods of reasoning, to persuade us
that we are not in a state of grace, or that God is an enemy
to us; and therefore our condition is desperate; in which he
uses the arts of the old serpent, that he may deceive us by drawing
conclusions against ourselves from false premises, <i>e. g.</i> because
we daily experience the internal workings of corrupt nature,
which inclines us to many sins, both of omission and commission;
therefore there is no room for us to expect mercy and
forgiveness from God. And from our barrenness and unprofitableness
under the means of grace, our improvements not
being proportioned to the obligations we have been laid under.
Or because we have had great reason to charge ourselves with
many declensions and backslidings, which afford matter for
deep humiliation, and should put us upon sincere repentance,
he endeavours to persuade us that we are altogether destitute
of special grace. And whenever we are unprepared or indisposed
for the right performance of holy duties, and our affections
are not suitably raised, but grow stupid, remiss, and careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>therein; he puts us upon concluding that it is a vain thing
for us to draw nigh to God, and that he has utterly rejected,
both our persons and services. Or, if we are not favoured with
immediate returns of prayer, and sensible communion with
God therein; he tempts us to infer, that we shall never obtain
the blessing we are pressing after; and therefore we may as
well lay aside this duty, and say, why should I wait on the
Lord any longer? And if by this method he cannot discourage
us from engaging in holy duties, he sometimes injects blasphemous
thoughts or unbecoming conceptions of the divine
Majesty, which fills the soul with the greatest grief and uneasiness,
that hereby he might give us occasion to conclude that
we sin in persisting therein; and by all these temptations he
endeavours to plunge us into the depths of despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what concerns the purpose of God relating to the event
of things: when we are led to determine that we are not elected,
this is alleged without sufficient ground, and therein he
deceives us, by pursuing the same false methods of reasoning,
and puts us upon presuming to enter into those secret things
which do not belong to us, because we deserve to be cast off
by him for our sins, instead of giving diligence to make our
calling and election sure. It is one thing not to be able to conclude
that we are elected; and another thing to say that we are
not so: the former of these is the consequence of our present
doubts and desponding apprehensions concerning our state; the
latter is plainly a temptation of Satan: this we are often subject
to, when we have lost that assurance of our interest in
Christ that we once enjoyed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) A believer’s want of assurance is, for the most part, attended
with, and arises from divine desertion; not that we are
to suppose that God will cast off his people, whom he has foreknown,
effectually called and preserved hitherto, so as to forsake
them utterly; for that is inconsistent with his everlasting
love, and the promises of the covenant of grace, which respect
their salvation. But that which we understand by divine desertions,
is God’s withdrawing his comforting presence, and withholding
the witness of his Spirit to the work of grace in the
soul, from whence arises those doubts and fears which attend
the want thereof; as God says to his people, <i>For a small moment
have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather
thee</i>, Isa. liv. 7. In this respect they are destitute of God’s
comforting presence; though at the same time they may be favoured
with his supporting presence, and those powerful influences
which are necessary to maintain the work of grace;
which, at present, appears to be very weak and languishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us to consider the last thing mentioned in this
answer, <i>viz.</i> That though they are thus described, they are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God,
as keeps them from sinking into utter despair. This observation
ought to be explained and considered, with certain limitations,
lest while on the one hand, we assert that which affords
matter of encouragement to believers, when they have some degree
of hope, we should, on the other hand, throw discouragements
in the way of others, who will be apt to imagine, when
they are ready to sink into despair, that this is wholly inconsistent
with any direct act of faith. I dare not say that no believer
was ever so far deserted as to be left to despair of his
interest in Christ: inasmuch as scripture and daily experience
give us instances of some, whose conversation in many respects
discovers them to have had the truth of grace; whom God
has been pleased for wise ends, to leave to the terror of their
own thoughts, and they have remained for some time, in the
depths of despair; and others have gone out of the world under
a cloud, concerning whom there has been ground to hope
their state was safe. Therefore it is somewhat difficult to determine
what is meant in this answer, by a believer’s being kept
from sinking into utter despair: if the meaning is, that they
have the supports of the Spirit of God, so as to be kept from
relapsing into a state of unregeneracy, in their despairing condition,
that may be easily accounted for; or, if we are to understand
by it, that believers are not generally given up to the
greatest degree of despair; especially such as is inconsistent
with the exercise of any grace, that is not to be denied. But
I would rather say, that though a believer may have despairing
apprehensions concerning his state, and the guilt of sin lie
upon him like a great weight, so as to depress his spirits, yet
he shall not sink into endless misery; for though darkness may
continue for a night, light and joy shall come in the morning;
and accordingly we may consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That though there are many who are far from having
assurance, yet they are at some times, favoured with a small
glimmering of hope, which keeps them from utter despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If they are in deep despair, yet they are not so far left
as not to desire grace, though they conclude themselves to be
destitute of it, or not to lament the loss of those comforts, and
their being unable to exercise those graces which once they
thought themselves possessed of.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] A believer, when in a despairing way, is notwithstanding
enabled, by a direct act of faith, to give up himself to Christ,
though he cannot see his interest in him, and so, long for those
experiences and comforts which he once enjoyed; and when
he is at the worst, he can say with Job, <i>Though he slay me,
yet will I trust in him</i>, Job xiii. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] In this case a person has generally such a degree of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>presence of God, as that he is enabled to justify him in all his
dealings with him, and lay the blame of all the troubles that he
is under, on himself; and this is attended with shame and confusion
of face, self-abhorrence, and godly sorrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] Despairing believers have, notwithstanding, such a presence
of God with them, as keeps them from abandoning his
interest, or running, with sinners, into all excess of riot, which
would give occasion to others to conclude that they never had
the truth of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning true believers being
destitute of assurance, and yet having some degree of the presence
of God with them at the same time, we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That this is not inconsistent with what has been said
concerning a believer’s perseverance in grace; yet it must be
considered with this limitation, that though the truth of grace
shall not be lost, yet the comforts and evidences thereof may,
and often are.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, This should put us upon circumspect walking and
watchfulness against presumptuous sins, which, as has been
before observed, are often the occasion of the loss of assurance;
and also on the exercise of a faith of reliance on Christ, for the
maintaining the acts of grace, as well as restoring the comforts
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, This should instruct believers what to do when destitute
of this privilege of assurance. We have observed that this
is attended with divine desertion, which is generally occasioned
by sins committed. Therefore let us say with Job, <i>Shew me
wherefore thou contendest with me</i>, chap. x. 2. let me know
what are those secret sins by which I have provoked thee to
leave me destitute of thy comforting presence; enable me to be
affected with, humbled for, and unfeignedly repent of them;
and exercise that faith in Christ which may be a means of my
recovering that hope or assurance which I am, at present, destitute
of.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, What has been said concerning a believer’s being destitute
of assurance, should put us upon sympathizing with those
who are in a despairing way, and using endeavours to administer
comfort to them, rather than censure them, or conclude
them to be in an unregenerate state; as Job’s friends did him,
because the hand of God had touched him, and he was destitute
of his comforting presence.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, From what has been said concerning that degree of
the presence of God which believers enjoy, which has a tendency
to keep them from utter despair, at least, from sinking
into perdition, how disconsolate soever their case may be at
present; we may be induced to admire the goodness and faithfulness
of God in his dealings with his people, who will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>lay more on them than he will enable them to bear; though
they are comfortless and hopeless, yet they shall not be destroyed;
and, in the end, they shall be satisfied with God’s loving
kindness; and when the clouds are all dispersed, they shall
have a bright and glorious day in his immediate presence,
where <i>there is fulness of joy</i>, and at his <i>right hand</i> where <i>there
are pleasures for evermore</i>, Psal. xvi. 11.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXII.</span> <i>What is the communion in glory, which the
members of the invisible church have with Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The communion in glory, which the members of the
invisible church have with Christ, is, in this life, immediately
after death; and at last perfected at the resurrection and
day of judgment.</p>

<p class='c012'>After having considered believers, or the members of the
invisible church, as enjoying this privilege of union with
Christ, and, as the immediate consequence hereof, communion
with him. It has been farther observed, that this communion
with him, is either in grace, or glory. Their communion with
him in grace consists in their partaking of the virtue of his
mediation, in their justification, adoption, and sanctification;
which have been particularly considered, together with other
graces and comforts that accompany or flow from them. We
are now led to speak concerning the communion which they
have with him in glory; which contains the highest privilege
they are capable of receiving; consisting in his giving them
some right discoveries of the glory which they behold and enjoy
by faith, in this life, and also of that which shall be immediate,
and, in some respects, complete, after death; and, at the
resurrection and day of judgment, be brought, in all respects,
to the utmost degree of perfection; when their joy, as well as
their happiness, shall be full, and continued throughout all the
ages of eternity. These are the subjects insisted on in several
following answers, which remain to be considered in this first
part of the Catechism.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-83' class='c003'>Quest. LXXXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXIII.</span> <i>What is the communion in glory, with
Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy in this
life?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The members of the invisible church have communicated
to them in this life, the first-fruits of glory with Christ,
as they are members of him their head, and so, in him, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>interested in that glory which he is fully possessed of; and
as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of God’s love, peace
of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of glory; as,
on the contrary, the sense of God’s revenging wrath, horror
of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment, are, to
the wicked, the beginning of their torments which they shall
endure after death.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are two sorts of persons mentioned in this answer,
namely, the righteous and the wicked, and the different
condition of each of them considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. With respect to the righteous, who are here styled the
members of the invisible church. There are several invaluable
privileges which they are made partakers of in this life,
in which they are said to have a degree of communion in glory
with Christ; particularly as they enjoy the first-fruits or
earnest of that glory which they shall have with him hereafter:
And that,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As they are members of him, their head; and accordingly
may be said, in some respects, to be interested in that
glory which he is fully possessed of.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As they have a comfortable sense of his love to them, attended
with peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and
an hope of glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We have an account, on the other hand, of the dreadful
condition of impenitent sinners, when God sets their iniquities
in order before them; which is represented in a very moving
way. Thus they are said to be filled with a sense of God’s
revenging wrath, horror of conscience, and a fearful expectation
of judgment; which is considered as the beginning of those
torments which they shall endure after death.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. There are several invaluable privileges which the righteous
enjoy in this life, that are styled the first-fruits or earnest
of glory. Though Christ has reserved the fulness of glory
for his people hereafter, when he brings them to heaven; yet
there are some small degrees thereof, which they enjoy in their
way to it. The <i>crown of righteousness</i>, as the apostle speaks,
is <i>laid up for them, which the righteous Judge shall give them
at that day</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 8. to wit, when we shall come to judgment;
then their joy shall be full; they shall be satisfied in
his likeness, and made compleatly blessed: Nevertheless there
are some prelibations, or foretastes, which they have hereof, for
their support and encouragement, while they are in this imperfect
state. For the understanding of this it may be premised,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That we are not to suppose that the present enjoyments
which believers experience in the highest degree, do fully come
up to those that are reserved for them. There is a great difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>as to the degree thereof. As a child that is newly born
has something in common with what he shall have when arrived
at a state of manhood; but there are several degrees, and other
circumstances, in which he falls short of it: or, as a few drops
are of the same nature with the whole collection of water in
the ocean; yet there is a very small proportion between one
and the other: so the brightest discovery of the glory of God,
which we are capable of enjoying in this world; or the comfortable
foretastes that believers have of heaven, fall very
much short of that which they shall be possessed of, when
they are received into it. And there are very great allays,
and many things that tend to interrupt and abate their happiness,
agreeably to the imperfection of this present state. Whatever
grace they are enabled to act, though in an uncommon
degree, is attended with a mixture of corruption; and as their
graces are imperfect, so are the comforts that arise from thence,
which are interwoven with many things very afflictive; so that
they are not what they shall be, but are travelling through this
wilderness to a better country, and exposed to many evils in
their way thither.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. All believers do not enjoy these delights and pleasures
that some are favoured with in their way to heaven; the comforts,
as well as the graces, of the Holy Spirit, are bestowed
in a way of sovereignty, to some more, and to others less:
Some have reason to say with the apostle, <i>Thanks be unto God,
which always causeth us to triumph in Christ</i>, 2 Cor. ii. 14.
others are filled with doubts concerning their interest in him,
and go mourning after him all the day; and if they have, at
some times a small glimpse of his glory, by which they conclude
themselves to be, as it were, in the suburbs of heaven,
they soon lose it, and find themselves to be in the valley of the
shadow of death, as the disciples, when they were with Christ
at his transfiguration, which was an emblem of the heavenly
blessedness, when his <i>face did shine as the sun, and his raiment
was white as the light</i>; which occasioned them to say, <i>it is good
for us to be here</i>; before they had done speaking, or had time
to reflect on their present enjoyment they were deprived of it
when <i>the cloud overshadowed them</i>, Matt. xvii. 2,-5. so the
believer is not to expect uninterrupted communion with God,
or perfect fruition with him here. However, that which we
are at present to consider, is that degree thereof which some
enjoy; which is here called the first-fruits and earnest of glory.
The scripture sets it forth under both these expressions.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) They are said to receive the first-fruits thereof; or as
the apostle styles it, <i>The first-fruits of the Spirit</i>, Rom. viii.
23. that is, the graces and comforts of the Holy Ghost, which
are the first-fruits of that blessedness, that they are said to wait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>for; which is called <i>the adoption</i>, viz. those privileges which
God’s children shall be made partakers of; or, <i>the glorious
liberty</i> which they shall hereafter enjoy. This is styled, the
<i>first-fruits</i>, as alluding to the cluster of grapes, which they who
were sent to spy out the land of Canaan, were ordered to bring
to the Israelites in the wilderness, that hereby they might be
encouraged in their expectation of the great plenty that was to
be enjoyed when they were brought to it. Or, it has reference
to the feast of ingathering, before the harvest, when they were
to bring the sheaf which was first to be cut down, and <i>wave it
before the Lord</i>, Lev. xxiii. 10, 11. compared with Deut. xxvi.
10, 11. with thankfulness and joy, in expectation of the full
harvest, which would be the reward of the industry and labour
of the husbandman. Thus believers are given not only to expect,
but to rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) This is also called an earnest of glory. Thus believers
are said to be <i>sealed with that holy Spirit of promise which is
the earnest of their inheritance</i>, Eph. i. 13, 14. and elsewhere
it is said, <i>God hath given us the earnest of his Spirit</i>, 2 Cor. i.
5. An earnest is a small sum, given in part of payment;
whereby they who receive it, are encouraged hereafter to expect
the whole: So a believer may conclude, that as sure as he
now enjoys those spiritual privileges that accompany salvation,
he shall not fail of that glory which they are an earnest of. In
this respect God is pleased to give his people a wonderful instance
of his condescending love, that they may hereby be led
to know what the happiness of the heavenly state is, in a greater
degree than can be learned from all the descriptions that
are given of it, by those who are destitute of this privilege.
Heaven is the port to which every believer is bound, the reward
of all those labours and difficulties which he sustains in
his way to it; and to quicken him to the greater diligence in
pursuing after it, it is necessary that he should have his thoughts,
meditation, and conversation there. The reason why God is
pleased to give his people some foretastes thereof, is, that they
may love and long for Christ’s appearing, when they shall reap
the full harvest of glory. Now this earnest, prelibation, or
first-fruits of the heavenly blessedness which believers enjoy
in this life, is considered in this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] As it is included in that glory which Christ is possessed
of as their head and Mediator.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] As they have those graces wrought in them, and comforts
flowing from thence, which bear some small resemblance
to what they shall hereafter be made partakers of.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] Christ’s being possessed of the heavenly blessedness, as
the head of his people, is an earnest of their salvation. For
the understanding of which, let it be considered, that our Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Jesus sustained this character, not only in what he suffered for
them, that he might redeem them from the curse of the law;
but in the glory which he was afterwards advanced to: <i>Thus
it is said, that he is risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits
of them that slept</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 20. and accordingly they are said
to be <i>risen with him</i>, Col. iii. 1. as respecting that communion
which they have with him herein; and when, after this, he ascended
into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty
on high, his people are said <i>to sit together in heavenly
places in him</i>, Eph. ii. 6. not that we are to suppose that they
are made partakers of any branch of his mediatorial glory, or
joined with him in the work which he there performs, as their
exalted head: But his being considered as their representative,
appearing in the presence of God for them, is a foundation of
their hope that they shall be brought hither at last; and therefore,
when he is about to depart out of this world, he gave an
intimation to his people, whom he left behind him in it, that he
went <i>to prepare a place for them</i>, John xiv. 3. and assures them,
that <i>because he lives they shall live also</i>, ver. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] The graces and comforts of the Holy Spirit, which believers
are made partakers of, may also be said to be a pledge
and earnest of eternal life. Heaven is a state in which grace
is brought to perfection, which, at present, is only begun in the
soul: nevertheless, the beginning thereof affords ground of
hope that it shall be compleated. As a curious artist, when
he draws the first lines of a picture, does not design to leave
it unfinished; or he that lays the foundation of a building, determines
to carry it on gradually, till he has laid the top-stone
of it; so the work of grace, when begun by the Spirit, is a
ground of hope that it shall not be left unfinished. As God
would never have brought his people out of Egypt with an
high hand and an outstretched arm, and divided the red sea
before them, if he had not designed to bring them into the promised
land; so we may conclude, that when God has magnified
his grace in delivering his people from the dominion of
darkness, and translating them into the kingdom of his dear
Son; when he has helped them hitherto, and given them a fair
and beautiful prospect of the good land to which they are going,
he will not leave his work imperfect, nor suffer them to
fall and perish in the way to it. Christ, in believers, is said
to be <i>the hope of glory</i>, Col. i. 27. and the joy which they have
in believing, is said not only to be <i>unspeakable</i>, but <i>full of glory</i>,
1 Pet. i. 8. that is, it bears a small resemblance to that joy
which they shall be filled with, when brought to glory, and
therefore may well be styled the earnest or first-fruits of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, that this may farther appear, let it be considered, that
the happiness of heaven consists in the immediate vision and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>fruition of God, where the saints behold his face in light and
glory<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a>, and enjoy all those comfortable fruits and effects that
arise from thence, which tend to make them compleatly happy.
Thus it is said, <i>They shall see him as he is</i>, 1 John iii. 2.
and they are said to <i>enter into the joy of their Lord</i>, Matt. xxv.
21. Believers, it is true, are not in all respects, said to be partakers
of this blessedness here; and their highest enjoyments
bear but a very small proportion to it: Yet, when we speak
of some as having the foretastes of it, we must consider, that
there is something in the lively exercise of faith, and the joy
that arises from it, when believers have attained the full assurance
of the love of God, and have those sensible manifestations
of his comfortable presence with them, that bears some
small resemblance to a life of glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which in some respects resembles the beatific vision,
is a sight of God’s reconciled face, and of their interest in all
the blessings of the covenant of grace, by faith. It is true, the
views which they have of the glory of God here, are not immediate,
but at a distance; and therefore they are said to <i>behold</i>,
<i>as in a glass, the glory of the Lord</i>, 2 Cor. iii. 18. Thus
we see things at a distance, as through a perspective glass,
which enlarges the object<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a>, and brings it, as it were, near to the
eye, though in reality, it be at a great distance from it; and so
gives us a clear discerning of that which could otherwise hardly
be discovered: So faith gives us clearer views of this glory
than we could have any other way. Hereby we are said <i>to see
him that is invisible</i>, Heb. xi. 27. Thus, when God bade Moses
go up to the top of Pisgah, and strengthened his sight, he
took a view of the whole land of Canaan, though without this
he could only have beheld a small part thereof: So when God
not only gives an eye of faith, but strengthens it in proportion
to the views he designs it shall take of the heavenly state, that
lies at so great a distance, the soul is enabled to see it, and
herein has a faint emblem of the beatific vision.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as heaven is a state, in which the saints have the
perfect fruition of those blessings which tend to make them
compleatly happy; the view which a believer is enabled, by
faith, to take of his interest in Christ, and the glory he shall be
made partaker of with him, is sometimes attended with such
an extasy of joy and triumph, as is a kind of anticipation of that
glory which he is not yet fully possessed of. Such an one is
like an heir who wants but a few days of being of age; who
does not look upon his estate with that distant view which he
before did, but with the satisfaction and pleasure that arises
from his being ready to enter into the possession of it; or like
one who after a long and tedious voyage, is within sight of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>harbour, which he cannot but behold with a pleasure, which
very much resembles that which he shall have when he enters
into it; this is more than a bare hope of heaven; it is a full
assurance, attended with a kind of sensation of those joys which
are inexpressible, which render the believer a wonder to himself,
and afford the most convincing proof to others, that there
is something real and substantial in the heavenly glory, whereof
God is pleased to favour some of his people with the
prelibations. That some have enjoyed such-like manifestations
of the divine love to them, and been filled with those raptures
of joy, accompanying that assurance which they have had
of their salvation, is evident from the experience which they
have had of it in some extraordinary and memorable occurrences
in life; and others at the approach of death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of this there are multitudes of instances transmitted to us in
history: I shall content myself with a brief extract of some
passages which we meet with in the life and death of some who
appear to have had as comfortable a foretaste of the joys of
heaven, as it is possible for any one to have in this world. And
the first that I shall mention is that eminently learned and pious
Dr. Rivet; who, in his last sickness seemed to be in the very
suburbs of heaven, signifying to all about him, what intimate
communion he had with God, and fore-views of the heavenly
state; his assurance of being admitted into it; and how earnestly
he longed to be there: and, in the very close of life, one who
stood by him could not forbear expressing himself to this purpose;
I cannot but think that he is now enjoying the vision of
God, which gave him occasion to signify that it was so, as well
as he was able to express himself, which account, and much
more to the same purpose, is not only mentioned by the author
of his last hours, but is taken notice of in a public funeral oration,
occasioned by his death.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And what a very worthy writer observes,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a> concerning that
excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Rutherford, who recites some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of his last words to this purpose, is very remarkable, who says,
“I shall shine, I shall see him as he is, and all the fair company
with him, and shall have my large share. It is no easy
thing to be a Christian; but as for me, I have got the victory;
and Christ is holding forth his arms to embrace me. I have
had my fears and faintings, as another sinful man, to be carried
through creditably; but as sure as ever he spake to me
in his word, his Spirit witnessed to my heart, saying, Fear
not; he had accepted my suffering, and the outgate should
not be matter of prayer, but of praise.” And a little before
his death, after some fainting, he said, “Now I feel, I believe,
I enjoy, I rejoice, I feed on manna, I have angels’ food, my
eyes shall see my Redeemer; I know that he shall stand, at
the latter day, on the earth, and I shall be caught up in the
clouds to meet him in the air. I sleep in Christ; and when
I awake I shall be satisfied with his likeness; O for arms to
embrace him!” And to one speaking concerning his painfulness
in the ministry, he cried out, “I disdain all; the port I
would be in at, is redemption and forgiveness of sins through
his blood.” And thus, full of the Spirit; yea, as it were overcome
with sensible enjoyment, he breathes out his soul, his last
words being these; “Glory, glory dwelleth in Emmanuel’s
land.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To this I may add the account given of that great man Dr.
Goodwin, in some memoirs of his life, composed out of his
own papers published by his son,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> who intimates that he rejoiced
in the thoughts that he was dying, and going to have a
full and uninterrupted communion with God; “I am going,
said he, to the three Persons with whom I have had communion;
they have taken me, I did not take them; I shall
be changed in the twinkling of an eye; all my lusts and corruptions
I shall be rid of, which I could not be here; those
croaking toads will fall off in a moment.” And mentioning
those great examples of faith, Heb. xi. said he, “All these died
in faith. I could not have imagined I should ever had such
a measure of faith in this hour; no, I could never have imagined
it. My bow abides in strength. Is Christ divided?
No, I have the whole of his righteousness; I am found in
him, not in my own righteousness, which is of the law; but
in the righteousness which is of God, which is by faith of
Jesus Christ, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Christ
cannot love me better than he doth; I think I cannot love
Christ better than I do; I am swallowed up in God:” and
then he says, “Now shall I ever be with the Lord.” With
this assurance of faith, and fulness of joy his soul left this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>world, and went to see and enjoy the reality of that blessed
state of glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is also an account, in the life and death of Mr. John
Janeway, of the great assurance and joy which he had in his
last sickness, in which he expresses himself to this purpose;
“I am, through mercy, quite above the fears of death, and am
going unto him whom I love above life. O that I could let
you know what I now feel! O that I could shew you what
I see! O that I could express the thousandth part of that
sweetness which now I find in Christ! you would all then
think it worth the while to make it your business to be religious.
O my dear friends, you little think what a Christ is
worth upon a death-bed! I would not, for a world, nay, for
millions of worlds, be now without Christ and a pardon. O
the glory! the unspeakable glory that I behold! My heart
is full, my heart is full; Christ smiles and I cannot choose
but smile. Can you find in your heart to stop me, who am
now going to the complete and eternal enjoyment of Christ?
Would you keep me from my crown? The arms of my
blessed Saviour are open to embrace me; the angels stand
ready to carry my soul into his bosom. O did you but see
what I see, you would all cry out with me, How long dear
Lord, come Lord Jesus, come quickly? Or why are his
chariot-wheels so long a coming?” Much more to the same
purpose may be found in the life of that excellent man, which
is exceedingly affecting.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there is another who does not come short of him in his
death-bed triumphs;<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a> who says concerning himself, “Death
is not terrible, it is unstinged; the curse of the fiery law is
done away: I bless his name I found him; I am taken up
in blessing him; I am dying rejoicing in the Lord; I long
to be in the promised land; I wait for thy salvation; how
long! Come sweet Lord Jesus, take me by the hand; I wait
for thy salvation, as the watchman watcheth for the morning;
I am weary with delays; I faint for thy salvation: Why
are his chariot-wheels so long a coming? What means he to
stay so long? I am like to faint with delays.” After that he
said, “O Sirs, I could not believe that I could have born, and
born cheerfully this rod so long: This is a miracle, pain without
pain. And this is not a fancy of a man disordered in his
brain, but of one lying in full composure: O blessed be God
that ever I was born; O if I were where he is! And yet, for
all this, God’s withdrawing from me would make me as weak
as water: all this I enjoy, though it be a miracle upon miracle,
would not make me stand without new supply from God;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the thing I rejoice in is, that God is altogether full; and that
in the Mediator Christ Jesus, there is all the fulness of the
Godhead, and it will never run out. I am wonderfully helped
beyond the power of nature, though my body be sufficiently
teazed, yet my spirit is untouched.” Much more to this purpose
we have in the latter part of his life, which I shall close
with one thing that is very remarkable. When he was apprehensive
that he was very near his death, he said, “When I
fall so low that I am not able to speak, I’ll shew you a sign
of triumph, when I am near glory, if I be able;” which accordingly
he did, by lifting up his hands, and clapping them
together, when he was speechless, and in the agonies of death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many more instances might have been given to illustrate this
argument, whereby it will evidently appear, that God is pleased,
sometimes, to deal familiarly with men, by giving them extraordinary
manifestations of his presence, before he brings them
into the immediate enjoyment of himself in heaven; which
may be well called an earnest or prelibation thereof.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> And it
may serve as a farther illustration of an argument before insisted
on,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a> to prove that assurance of God’s love is attainable
in this life, from the various instances of those who have been
favoured with it. This assurance, as it may be observed, is
accompanied with the lively acts of faith, by which it appears
to be well grounded; so that, as the apostle says, <i>The God of
hope</i> is pleased to <i>fill them with all joy and peace in believing</i>;
whereby they <i>abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
Ghost</i>, Rom. xv. 13. in which respect it may be said, to use
the prophet’s words, that <i>they joy before thee, according to the
joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil</i>,
Isa. ix. 3. This is like the appearing of the morning-star, which
ushers in a bright and glorious day, and gives a full discovery
to themselves and others, that there is much of heaven enjoyed
in the way to it, by those whom God delights to honour. Thus
concerning the communion in glory, which the members of the
invisible church sometimes enjoy in this life; which leads us
to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The miserable condition of the wicked in this life, when
God is provoked, as a sin-revenging Judge, to fill them with
a sense of his wrath; from whence arises horror of conscience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>and a fearful expectation of judgment; which is the beginning
of those torments which they shall endure after death, as it is
observed in the latter part of this answer. We have many instances
in scripture, of the punishment of sin in this world, in
whom God is said <i>to reprove and set</i> their iniquities <i>in order
before their eyes</i>, Psal. l. 21. which fills them with horror of
conscience,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a> and leaves them in utter despair. They who once
thought themselves in a prosperous condition, concerning whom
it is said, <i>Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than
heart could wish</i>, Psal. lxxiii. 7. yet their end was terrible,
when it appears that they were <i>set in slippery places</i>, being <i>cast
down into destruction, brought into desolation as in a moment,
and utterly consumed with terrors</i>, ver. 18, 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have a sad instance of this in Cain, after he had slain his
brother, and fell under the curse of God, whereby he was sentenced
to be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth. He separated
himself indeed from the presence of the Lord, and the place in
which he was worshipped; but could not fly from the terrors of
his own thoughts, or get any relief under the uneasiness of a
guilty conscience; which made him fear that he should be slain
by the hand of every one that met him; and complain, <i>My
punishment is greater than I can bear</i>, Gen. iv. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>And some understand that expression of Lamech in the same
sense, when he says, <i>I have slain a man to my wounding, and a
young man to my hurt. If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold,
truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold</i>, Gen. iv. 23, 24. The
wrath of God was also denounced against Pashur; as it is said,
the <i>Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib;
for thus saith the Lord, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and
to all thy friends</i>, Jer. xx. 3, 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Judas, after he had betrayed our Saviour, was filled
with the terrors of an accusing conscience, which forced him
to confess, not as a believing penitent, but a despairing criminal;
<i>I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood</i>;
after which it is said, <i>He departed, and went and hanged himself</i>,
Matt, xxvii. 4, 5. Nothing is more terrible than this remorse
of conscience, which renders sinners inexpressibly miserable.
This is a punishment inflicted on those who sin wilfully,
presumptuously, and obstinately against the checks of conscience
and rebukes of providence, and various warnings to the
contrary, who treasure up to themselves wrath against the day
of wrath; who are <i>contentious, and do not obey the truth</i>; that
is, they are so far from obeying it, that they persecute and oppose
it; and, on the other hand, <i>obey unrighteousness</i>: to these
belong, as the apostle says, <i>indignation and wrath, tribulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and anguish</i>, Rom. ii. 5, 8, 9. This not only waits for them, as
<i>laid up in store, and sealed up among God’s treasures, to whom
vengeance belongeth</i>, Deut. xxxii. 34, 35. but they are made to
taste the bitterness of that cup, which shall afterwards be poured
forth without mixture. In this world <i>their eyes shall see
their destruction, and</i> afterwards <i>they shall drink of the wrath
of the Almighty</i>, Job xxi. 20. This is a most affecting subject;
how awful a thing is it to see a person surrounded with miseries,
and, at the same time, shut up in darkness, and left destitute
of hope! With what horror and anguish was the soul
of Saul filled, when he uttered that doleful complaint; <i>I am
sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and
God is departed from me</i>, 1 Sam. xxviii. 15. much more for a
person to apprehend himself fallen into the hands of the living
God, who is a consuming fire; and having nothing left but the
fearful expectation of future judgment, and an abyss of woes
that will ensue hereupon. These are the evils that some endure
in this life; which is no less terrible to them than the
comfortable foretastes of the love of God are joyful to the
saints.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the different view of the end of the wicked, and the
righteous, many useful instructions may be learned.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When we consider the wicked as distressed with the afflicting
sense of what they feel, and with the dread of that
wrath which they would fain flee from, but cannot, we may
infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That a state of unregeneracy, whatever advantages may
attend it, as to the outward blessings of common providence, is
a very sad and deplorable condition, far from being the object
of choice to those who duly consider the consequences hereof.
The present amusements that arise from the enjoyment of
sensual pleasures, from whence the sinner concludes himself to
be happy, is the most miserable instance of self-deceit, and will
appear to be so, if we consider the end thereof, or that <i>the
triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite
but for a moment</i>, Job xx. 5. and after that, nothing shall remain
but what wounds his spirit, and makes his misery intolerable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When we meet with instances of persons sunk in the
depths of despair, and tormenting themselves with the fore
views of hell and destruction, let this be a warning to others
to flee from the wrath to come. I would not be peremptory in
passing a judgment on the state of those who apprehend themselves
to be irretrievably lost, and feel those terrors in their
consciences which no tongue can express. A person can hardly
read the account of the despair of poor Spira, soon after
the reformation; and how much his sentiments concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>himself, resembled the punishment of sin in hell, without trembling:
he was, indeed, a sad instance, of the wrath of God
breaking in upon conscience; and is set up as a monument to
warn others, to take heed of apostacy; and in this, and suchlike
instances, we have a convincing proof of the reality of a
future state of misery; or, that the punishment of sin in hell
is not an ungrounded fancy: nevertheless, it is not for us to
enter into those secrets which belong not to us, or to reckon
him among the damned in another world, because he reckoned
himself among them in this. And as for any others that we
may see in the like circumstances, we are not so much to pass
a judgment concerning their future state, as to infer the desperate
estate of sinners, when left of God, and to bless him that
it is not our case. And on the other hand, let not unregenerate
sinners think that they are safe, merely because their consciences
are quiet, or rather stupid, since that false peace, which they
have, is no better than <i>the hope of the hypocrite</i>, which <i>shall
perish</i>, and be <i>cut off</i>; and his <i>trust shall be as a spider’s web</i>,
if he continue in his present condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning the happiness of the
righteous, in the enjoyment they have of the first fruits of the
heavenly glory, we may learn,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That this may afford farther conviction to us, that there
is a state of complete blessedness reserved for the saints in another
world; since, besides the arguments we have to prove this
taken from scripture, we have others founded in experience, so
far as it is possible for any to attain to the joys of heaven before
they come there. Though the instances we have here given
thereof are uncommon, yet this inference from them is just,
and may afford matter of conviction to those who are wholly
taken up with earthly things, and have no taste of, nor delight
in things spiritual, that religion has its own rewards attending
it, and consequently that a believer is the only happy man in
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) This may serve as an encouraging motive to induce
Christians to hold on their way. Whatever difficulties or distressing
providences they may meet with in this life, if they
have the earnest and foretastes of heaven at any time, this will
make their afflictions seem light; inasmuch as they work for
them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. And
if they are rather waiting and hoping for them, than actually
enjoying them, let them adore and depend on the sovereignty
of God, who dispenses these comforts when he pleases: and if
they are destitute of the joy of faith, let them endeavour to be
found in the lively exercise of the direct acts thereof, trusting
in Christ, though they have not such sensible communion with
him as others have; and let them bless God, (though they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>not those foretastes of the heavenly glory, which accompany a
full assurance thereof,) if they have a quiet, composed frame
of spirit, and are not given up to desponding thoughts, or unbelieving
fears, and have ground to conclude, that though their
state be not so comfortable as that of others; yet it is no less
safe, and shall, at last, issue into the fruition of that felicity of
which others have the first-fruits here on earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Let them who are at any time favoured with this privilege
of assurance, and the joy that arises from it, walk very
humbly with God, as being sensible that this frame of spirit is
not owing to themselves, but to the quickening and sealing influences
of the Holy Ghost; and if, by neglecting to depend
on him for the continuance thereof, we provoke him to leave
us to ourselves, we shall soon lose this desirable frame, and be
left in darkness: since as without him we can do nothing, so
without his continued presence we can enjoy none of those privileges
which tend to make our lives comfortable, and give us
an anticipation of future glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It is supposed, that death has a sting and curse attending
it with respect to force.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. It is the peculiar privilege of the righteous, that though
they shall not be delivered from death, yet this shall redound
to their advantage: For,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The sting and curse of it is taken from them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Their dying is the result of God’s love to them; and that
in three respects,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>(1.) As they are thereby freed from sin and misery.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As they are made capable of farther communion with
Christ in glory, beyond what they can have in this world.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) As they shall immediately enter upon that glorious and
blessed state when they die.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. God has determined, by an unalterable purpose and decree,
that all men must die. Whatever different sentiments persons
may have about other things, this remains an incontestable
truth. We have as much reason to conclude that we shall
leave the world, as, at present, we have that we live in it. <i>I
know</i>, says Job, <i>that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the
house appointed for all living</i>, Job xxx. 23. and upon this account
the Psalmist says, <i>I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner,
as all my fathers were</i>, Psal. xxxix. 12. And if scripture
had been wholly silent about the frailty of man, daily experience
would have afforded a sufficient proof of it. We have
much said concerning man’s mortality in the writings of the
heathen; but they are at a loss to determine the origin or first
cause of it; and therefore they consider it as the unavoidable
consequence of the frame of nature, arising from the contexture
thereof, as that which is formed out of the dust must be resolved
into its first principle; or that which is composed of flesh
and blood, cannot but be liable to corruption. But we have this
matter set in a true light in scripture, which considers death as
the consequence of man’s first apostacy from God. Before this
he was immortal, and would have always remained so, had he
not violated the covenant, in which the continuance of his immortality
was secured to him; the care of providence would
have prevented a dissolution, either from the decays of nature,
or any external means leading to it. And therefore some of the
Socinian writers have been very bold in contradicting the express
account we have hereof in Scripture, when they assert
that death was, at first, the consequence of nature;<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a> for which
reason man would have been liable to it, though he had not
sinned; whereas the apostle says, <i>By one man sin entered into
the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men,
for that all have sinned</i>, Rom. v. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have a particular account of this in the sentence God
passed on our first parents immediately after their fall; when
having denounced a curse upon the ground for their sake, he
says, <i>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return</i>, Gen. iii.
19. And it may be observed, that as this is unavoidable, pursuant
to the decree of God, so the constitution of our nature,
as well as the external dispensations of providence, lead to it.
This sentence no sooner took place, but the temperament of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>human bodies was altered,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a> the jarring principles of nature, on
the due temperament whereof life and health depends, could
not but have a tendency by degrees to destroy the frame thereof;
if there be too great a confluence of humours, or a defect
thereof; if heat or cold immoderately prevails; if the circulation
of the blood and juices be too swift or slow: or if the food
on which we live, or the air which we breathe be not agreeable
to the constitution of our nature, or any external violence be
offered to it; all these things have a necessary tendency to
weaken the frame of nature, and bring on a dissolution. David
includes the various means by which men die, in three general
heads, speaking concerning Saul, <i>The Lord shall smite him, or
his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle, and
perish: the Lord shall smite him</i>, 1 Sam. xxvi. 10. denotes a
person’s dying by a sudden stroke of providence, in which there
is the more immediate hand of God; and his <i>falling into battle</i>,
a violent death by the hands of men; in both which respects
men die before that time which they might have lived to, according
to the course of nature; and what is said concerning
his <i>day’s coming to die</i>; that is, a person’s dying what we call
a natural death, or when nature is so spent and wasted that it
can no longer subsist by all the skill of the physicians, or virtue
of medicine; and then the soul leaves its habitation, when
it is not longer able to perform the functions of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here consider those diseases that are the fore-runners
of death, which sometimes are more acute; and by this
means, as one elegantly expresses it, nature feels the cruel victory
before it yields to the enemy. As a ship that is tossed by
a mighty tempest, and by the concussion of the winds and
waves, loses its rudder and masts, takes water in every part,
and gradually sinks into the ocean: so in the shipwreck of nature,
the body is so shaken and weakened by the violence of a
disease, that the senses, the animal and vital operations decline,
and, at last, are extinguished in death.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a> This seemed, so formidable
to good Hezekiah, that he utters that mournful complaint,
<i>Mine age is departed and removed from me as a shepherd’s
tent: I have cut off like a weaver, my life; he will cut me
off with pining sickness: from day even to night, wilt thou make
an end of me. I reckoned till the morning, that as a lion, so will
he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an
end of me</i>, Isa. xxxvii. 12, 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here consider the empire of death as universal;
as the wise man says, <i>One generation passeth away, and another
generation cometh</i>, Eccl. i. 4. and then they pass away also,
like the ebbing and flowing of the sea. Death spares none; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>strongest constitution can no more withstand its stroke, than
the weakest; no age of man is exempted from it. This is beautifully
described by Job; <i>One dieth in his full strength, being
wholly at ease and quiet: his breasts are full of milk, and his
bones are moistened with marrow: and another dieth in the bitterness
of his soul; and never eateth with pleasure: they shall
lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them</i>, Job
xxi. 23-26.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also consider the body after death, as a prey for
worms, the seat of corruption; and lodged in the grave, the
house appointed for all living; and then an end is put to all the
actions, as well as enjoyments of this life; and, as the Psalmist
speaks, <i>In that very day</i> all <i>their thoughts perish</i>, Psal. cxlvi. 4.
Whatever they have been projecting, whatever schemes they
have laid, either for themselves or others, are all broken: as
the historian observes concerning the Roman emperor, that
when he had formed great designs for the advantage of the
empire,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a> death broke all his measures, and prevented the execution
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also consider it as putting an end to our present
enjoyments, removing us from the society of our dearest friends,
to a dismal and frightful solitude. This was one of the consequences
thereof, that was very afflictive to Hezekiah, when he
says, <i>I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the
world</i>, Isa. xxxviii. 11. It also strips us of all our possessions,
and the honours we have been advanced to in this world, as
the Psalmist speaks, <i>When he dieth he shall carry nothing
away, his glory shall not descend after him</i>, Psal. xlix. 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also consider the time of life and death as being
in God’s hand. As we were brought into the world by the sovereignty
of his providence, so we are called out of it at his
pleasure; concerning whom it is said, <i>Our times are in his hand</i>,
Psal. xxxi. 15. So that as nothing is more certain than death,
nothing is more uncertain to us than the time when. This God
has concealed from us for wise ends. Did we know that we
should soon die, it would discourage us from attempting any
thing great in life; and did we know that the lease of life was
long, and we should certainly arrive to old age; this might occasion
the delaying all concerns about our soul’s welfare, as
presuming that it was time enough to think of the affairs of
religion and another world, when we apprehend ourselves to
be near the confines thereof; and therefore, God has by this,
made it our wisdom, as well as our duty, to be waiting all the
days of our appointed time, till our change come.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said under this head, we may learn,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The vanity of man as mortal. Indeed, if we look on believers
as enjoying that happiness which lies beyond the grave,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>there is a very different view of things; but as to what respects
the world we have reason to say as the Psalmist does,
<i>Verily, every man at his best estate is altogether vanity</i>, Psal.
xxxix. 5. We may see the vanity of all those honours and
carnal pleasures which many pursue with so much eagerness,
as though they had nothing else to mind, nothing to make provision
for but the flesh, which they do at the expence of that
which is in itself most excellent and desirable: We may also
infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That this affords an undeniable and universal motive to
humility; since death knows no distinction of persons, regards
the rich no more than the poor; puts no mark of distinction
between the remains of a prince and a peasant; and not only
takes away every thing that men value themselves upon, but
levels the highest part of mankind with common dust: They
who boast of their extract, descent, and kindred, are obliged,
with Job, to say, <i>to corruption, Thou art my father; to the
worm, Thou art my mother and my sister</i>, Job xvii. 14. Shall
we be proud of our habitations, <i>who dwell in houses of clay,
whose foundation is in the dust?</i> chap. iv. 19. Are any proud
of their youth and beauty? this is, at best, but like a flower
that does not abide long in its bloom, and when cut down, it
withers. The finest features are not only spoiled by death, but
rendered unpleasant and ghastly to behold; and accordingly
are removed out of sight, and laid in the grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. From the consideration of man’s liableness to death, and
those diseases that lead to it, as the wages of sin, we may infer;
that sin is a bitter and formidable evil. The cause is to
be judged of by its effects. As death, accompanied with all
those diseases which are the forerunners of it, is the greatest
natural evil that we are liable to; sin, from whence it took its
rise, must be the greatest moral evil; we should never reflect
on the one without lying low before God in a sense of the
other. The Psalmist, when meditating on his own mortality,
traces it to the spring thereof; and ascribes it to those rebukes
with which <i>God corrects men for their iniquities</i>, that they die,
and their <i>beauty consumes away like a moth</i>, Psal. xxxix. 11.
And elsewhere, when he compares the life of man to the <i>grass</i>,
which <i>in the morning fourisheth, and groweth up; and in the
evening is cut down and withereth, he immediately adds; thou
hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of
thy countenance</i>, Psal. xc. 6, 8. And when Hezekiah had an
intimation of his recovery, after he had the sentence of death
within himself, he speaks of his deliverance from the <i>pit of corruption</i>,
Isa. xxxviii. 17. as that which was accompanied with
God’s <i>casting all his sins behind his back</i>. And since we cannot
be delivered from these sad effects of sin, till the frame of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>nature is dissolved, and afterwards rebuilt; it should put us
upon using those proper methods whereby we may be freed
from the guilt and dominion thereof; and accordingly it should
have a tendency to promote a life of holiness in us.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. From the uncertainty of life, let us be induced to improve
our present time, and endeavour so to live, as that, when God
calls us hence, we may be ready. And therefore, we ought
to pray with the Psalmist, <i>So teach us to number our days, that
we may apply our hearts unto wisdom</i>, Psal. xc. 12. that by this
means, that which deprives us of all earthly enjoyments, may
give us an admission into a better world, and be the gate to
eternal life. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. That death has a sting and curse annexed to it, with respect
to some. Thus the apostle expressly says, <i>The sting of
death is sin</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 56. As sin at first brought death into
the world; so it is the guilt thereof, lying on the consciences
of men, which is the principal thing that makes them afraid to
leave the world; not but that death is, in itself, an evil that
nature cannot think of without some reluctancy. And therefore
the apostle Paul, although he expresses that assurance
which he had of happiness in another world, which he <i>groaned</i>
after, and <i>earnestly</i> longed to be possessed of; yet had it been
put to his choice, he would have wished that he could have been
<i>clothed upon with the house which is from heaven</i>, 2 Cor. v. 2.
that is, had it been the will of God, that he might have been
brought to heaven without going the way of all the earth, this
would have been more agreeable to nature. But when the two
evils of death meet together, namely, that which is abhorrent
to nature, and the sting which makes it much more formidable,
this is, beyond measure, distressing. In this answer, the sting
and curse of death are both put together, as implying the same
thing. Accordingly, it is that whereby a person apprehends
himself liable to the condemning sentence of the law, separated
from God, and excluded from his favour, so that death appears
to him to be the beginning of sorrows; this is that which
tends to embitter it, and fills him with dread and horror at the
thoughts of it. Which leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. To shew that it is the peculiar privilege of the righteous,
that though they shall not be delivered from death, yet
this shall redound to their advantage. That they shall not be
exempted from death is evident; because the decree of God
relating hereunto, extends to all men. We read, indeed, of
two that escaped the grave, viz. Enoch, who was translated
that he should not see death, and Elijah, who was carried to
heaven in a fiery chariot; but these are extraordinary instances,
not designed as precedents, by which we may judge of the
common lot of believers. And the saints that shall be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>alive at Christ’s second coming, shall undergo a change<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a>, as
the apostle speaks; which though it be equivalent to death, it
cannot properly be styled a dying; inasmuch as he opposes it
thereunto, when he says, <i>We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
be changed</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 51. and he speaks of it as a future dispensation
of providence, which does not immediately concern
us in this present age. Therefore we must not conclude that
believers are delivered from the stroke of death; nevertheless,
this is ordered for their good, as the apostle says, with a particular
application to himself, <i>For me to die is gain</i>, Phil. i. 21.
And when he speaks of the many blessings that believers have
in possession or in reversion, he says, <i>Death is yours</i>; as though
he should say, it shall redound to your advantage; and this it
does if we consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the sting of death is taken away from them. This
is the result of their being in a justified state; for since a person’s
being liable to the condemning sentence of the law is the
principal thing that has a tendency to make him uneasy, and
may be truly called the sting that wounds the conscience; so
a sense of his interest in forgiveness through the blood of Christ,
tends to give peace to it; such an one can say, who shall lay
any thing to my charge? It is God that justifieth; or though
I have contracted guilt, which renders me unworthy of his favour;
yet I am persuaded that this guilt is removed; and
therefore iniquity shall not be my ruin; and even death itself
shall bring me to the possession of those blessings that were
purchased for me by the blood of Christ, which I have been
enabled to apply to myself by faith; and with this confidence
he can say with the apostle, <i>O death, where is thy sting? O
grave, where is thy victory?</i> 1 Cor. xv. 55.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Their dying is an instance of God’s love to them. As
those whom Christ is said to have <i>loved in the world, he loved
unto the end</i> of his life; so he loves them to the end of theirs,
John xiii. 1. And as nothing has hitherto separated them
from this love, nothing shall be able to do it. There are <i>three</i>
instances wherein the love of God to dying believers discovers
itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) In that they are hereby freed from sin and misery; this
they never were, nor can be till then. As for sin, there are the
remainders thereof in the best of men, which give them great
disturbance, and occasion for that daily conflict which there is
between flesh and spirit, as has been before observed. But at
death the conflict will be at an end, and the victory which they
shall obtain over it, compleat. There shall be no law in the
members warring against the law of the mind; no propensity
or inclination to what is evil; nor any guilt or defilement contracted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>which would be inconsistent with a state of perfect
holiness. And as it is a state of perfect happiness, there is an
entire freedom from all those miseries which sin brought into
this lower world. These are either internal or external, personal
or relative; none of which shall occur to allay, or give
any disturbance to the saints’ blessedness after death. But
more of this will be considered under a following answer; in
which we shall be led to speak of the happiness of the righteous
at the day of judgment, both in soul and body<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a>; and
therefore we proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That the death of a believer appears to be an instance
of divine love, in that hereby he is made capable of farther
communion with Christ in glory. Persons must be made meet
for heaven before they are admitted to it. Though our present
season and day of grace is a time in which God is training
his people up for glory; and there is an habitual preparation
for it, when the work of grace is begun; which is what
the apostle intends when he speaks of some who are <i>made meet
to be made partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light</i>,
Col. ii. 12. when they were first translated into Christ’s kingdom:
nevertheless this falls very short of that actual meetness
which the saints must have when they are brought to the
possession of the heavenly blessedness. Then they shall be
made perfect in holiness, as will be observed in the next answer;
otherwise there can be no perfect happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>And besides this, the soul must be more enlarged, that hereby
it may be enabled to receive the immediate discoveries of
the divine glory, or to converse with the heavenly inhabitants,
than it can be here. The frame of nature must be changed;
which is what the apostle intends, when he says, <i>Flesh and
blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 50. accordingly he adds, ver.
53. <i>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality</i>; whereby he intimates, that frail, mortal,
and corruptible man, is not able to bear that glory which
is reserved for a state of immortality. Therefore the soul
must be so changed as to be rendered receptive thereof; and
in order thereto, all its powers and faculties must be greatly
enlarged; otherwise it can no more receive the immediate rays
of the divine glory, than the weak and distempered eye can
look steady on the sun shining in its meridian brightness. In
this world our ideas of divine things are very imperfect, by
reason of the narrowness of our capacities, and God condescends
to reveal himself to us in proportion thereto; but when
the saints shall see him as he is, or have a perfect and immediate
vision and fruition of his glory, they shall be made receptive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of it; this is done at death; whereby they are rendered
capable of farther communion with Christ in glory.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>(3.) At death believers immediately enter upon, and are admitted
into the possession of this glory. At the same time that
the soul is enlarged and fitted for the work and enjoyment of
heaven, it is received into it; where it shall have an uninterrupted
communion with Christ in glory; which is the subject
insisted on in the following answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-86' class='c003'>Quest. LXXXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXVI.</span> <i>What is the communion in glory with
Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately
after death?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The communion in glory with Christ, which the members
of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death,
is, in that their souls are then made perfect in holiness, and
received into the highest heavens, where they behold the
face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption
of their bodies, which, even in death, continue united
to Christ, and rest in their graves as in their beds, till at the
last day they be again united to their souls: Whereas the
souls of the wicked are at death cast into hell, where they
remain in torments and utter darkness, and their bodies kept
in their graves, as in their prisons, till the resurrection and
judgment of the great day.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having considered the soul as separated from the body
by death; the next thing that will be enquired into, is
what becomes of it, and how it is disposed of in its separate
state? and here we find that there is a vast difference between
the righteous and the wicked in this respect: the former have
communion with Christ in glory, the latter are in a state of
banishment and separation from him; being cast into hell, and
there remaining in torments and utter darkness. Both these
are particularly insisted on in this answer. In speaking to
which, we must consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>I. That there is something supposed; namely, that the soul
of man is immortal; otherwise it could not be capable of happiness
or misery.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall consider the happiness which the members of
the invisible church enjoy; which is called communion with
Christ in glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The misery which the souls of the wicked endure at
death; which is contained in the latter part of the answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To speak concerning the thing supposed in this answer;
namely, that the soul of man is immortal. This is a subject
of that importance, that we must be first convinced of the truth
of it before we can conclude that there is a state of happiness
or misery in another world. But before we proceed to the
proof of it, it is necessary for us to explain what we are to understand
thereby; accordingly let it be premised,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That we read, in scripture, of the death of the soul, in a
spiritual sense, as separated by sin, from God, the fountain of
life and blessedness, and as being destitute of a principle of
grace; whereby it is utterly indisposed to perform any actions
that are spiritually good, as much as a dead man is unable to
perform the functions of life. In this sense we are to understand
the apostle’s words, <i>She that liveth in pleasure is dead
while she liveth</i>, 1 Tim. v. 6. And in this respect unregenerate
persons are said to be <i>dead in trespasses and sins</i>, Eph. ii.
1. and a condemned state, which is the consequence hereof, is
a state of death. Now that which is opposed hereunto, is called,
in scripture, a spiritual life, or immortality; but this is not
the sense in which we are to consider it in our present argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Immortality may be considered as an attribute peculiar
to God, as the apostle says, <i>he only hath immortality</i>, 1 Tim.
vi. 16. the meaning of which is, that his life, which includes
his Being, and all his perfections, is necessary and independent;
but in this respect no creature is immortal; but their life
is maintained by the will and providence of God, which gave
being to it at first.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When we speak of creatures being immortal, we must
consider them either as not having any thing in the constitution
of their nature, that tends to a dissolution, which cannot
be effected by any second cause; or their eternal existence,
pursuant to the will of God, who could, had he pleased, have
annihilated them. It is in both these senses that we are to consider
the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>That it is in its own nature immortal, has been allowed by
many of the Heathens, who have had just conceptions of the
spirituality of its nature, possessed due regards to the providence
of God, and those marks of distinction that he puts between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>good and bad men, as the consequence of their behaviour
in this life. That the soul survives the body, has been reckoned,
by some of the Heathens, as an opinion that has almost universally
obtained in the world<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a>. Thus Plato introduces Socrates<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
as discoursing largely on this subject, immediately before
his death: and, in some, other of his writings, not only
asserts, but gives as good proofs of this doctrine as any one,
destitute of scripture-light, could do. One of his followers, in
the account he gives of his doctrine, recommends and insists
on an argument which he brings to prove it, which is not without
its weight, namely, that the soul acts from a principle seated
in its own nature, and not by the influence of some external
cause, as things material do<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a>. And Strabo speaks of the ancient
Brachmans, among the Indians, as entertaining some notions
of the immortality of the soul, and the judgment passed
upon it in its separate state; agreeable to what Plato advances
on that subject<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some, indeed, have thought that this notion took its rise from
Thales, the Milesian, who lived between two and three hundred
years before Plato, and about six hundred years before the
Christian Æra, from an occasional passage mentioned by Diogenes
Laertius, in his life, which is hardly sufficient to justify this
supposition; which he brings in only as matter of report<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a>:
And Cicero<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a> supposes it was first propagated by Pherecydes,
who was cotemporary with him; though Diogenes Laertius
makes no mention of it. But it may be inferred from many
things in Homer, the oldest writer in the Greek tongue, who
lived above three hundred years before Thales, that the world
had entertained some confused ideas of it in his time: As we
often find him bringing in the souls of the deceased heroes appearing
in a form, and speaking with a voice like that which
they had when living, to their surviving friends. And he not
only supposes, but plainly intimates that their souls existed in
a separate state<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a>. And in other places he represents some suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>punishment for their crimes committed here on earth<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a>;
which plainly argues, whatever fabulous account we have of the
nature of punishment, or the person suffering it, that it was an
opinion, generally received at that time, that the soul existed in
a separate state.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, indeed, this maybe inferred from the doctrine of Dæmons,
or the superstitious worship of the heathens, which they
paid to the souls of those heroes who formerly lived on earth,
and had done some things which they thought rendered them
the peculiar favourites of God, and the objects of worship by
men; and that their souls existed with God in great honour
and favour in a separate state<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. But passing this by, it may be
farther observed, that whatever notions some of the heathens
had of the immortality of the soul in general; they were very
much at a loss, many of them, in determining the place, or many
things relating to the state in which they were; and therefore
many of them, with Pythagoras, asserted the doctrine of
transmigration of souls, or their passing from one body to another;
and being condemned to reside in vile and dishonourable
bodies; which, though it perverts, yet doth not overthrow the
doctrine of the soul’s immortality; and others seemed to doubt
whether, after four or five courses of transmigration of souls
from one body to another, they might not at last shrivel into
nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must also be acknowledged, that there was a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>party among the heathen that adhered to the sentiments of Epicurus,
who denied the immortality of the soul, as supposing it
to be material. And the Sadducees are represented, in scripture,
as imbibing that notion; who are said to deny both angels
and spirits, Acts xxiii. 8. In this respect they gave into
his philosophy, as to what concerns his denying the immortality
of the soul, or its existence in a future state<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a>: But passing
this by, we may observe, that notwithstanding all that has been
said concerning this doctrine, by the better and wiser part of
the heathen in their writings; yet their notions seem very defective,
if we trace them farther than what concerns the bare
separate existence of the soul; or, if they attempt to speak any
thing concerning its happiness in a future state, they then discover
that they know but little of this matter; and many of
them, though they cannot deny the soul’s immortality, yet they
seem to hesitate about it; and therefore we may say with the
apostle, that <i>life and immortality is brought to light through the
gospel</i>, 2 Tim. i. 10. that is, if we would be sure of the immortality
of the soul, and know its state and enjoyments in another
world, we must look farther than the light of nature for it:
and in seeking for arguments in scripture, we shall find great
satisfaction concerning this matter, which we cannot do from
the writers before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>That some of the heathen were in doubt about this important
truth, is very evident from their writings; for Plato himself<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a>,
notwithstanding the many things which he represents
Socrates as saying, concerning a state of immortality after death,
endeavouring to convince his friend Cebes about that matter,
and apprehending that he had so far prevailed in the argument,
as that his antagonist allowed that the soul survived the body,
but yet held the transmigration of souls into other bodies; this
he seems to allow him, and adds, that it is uncertain whether
the soul, having worn out many bodies, may not at last perish
with one that it is united to<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a>. And he farther says to him, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>I must now die, and you shall live; but which of us is in the
better state God only knows<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Aristotle, though, in many places of his writings, he
seems to maintain the immortality of the soul; yet in others it
appears that he is in doubt about it; and seems to assert, that
neither good nor evil happens to any man after his death<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a>.
And the Stoicks, who did not altogether deny this doctrine;
yet they supposed that in process of time, it would be dissolved<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a>.
And even Cicero himself, notwithstanding all that he
says, by which he seems to give into this doctrine; yet sometimes
speaks with great hesitation about it<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a>. And notwithstanding
what Seneca says concerning the immortality of the
soul, as has been often before observed; yet he speaks doubtfully
of it<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a>; so that we must have recourse to scripture, and
those consequences that are deduced from it, as well as those
things that may be inferred from the nature of the soul to prove
that it is immortal. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) For the proof of this doctrine, let it be considered, that
the soul is immaterial; which appears from its being capable
of thought, whereby it is conversant about, and takes in ideas
of things divine and spiritual, which no creature below man can
do. It has a power of inferring consequences from premises,
and accordingly is the subject of moral government, capable
of conversing with God here, and expecting rewards or punishments
from him hereafter; all this cannot be produced by matter
or motion: As for matter, that is in itself altogether unactive;
and when motion is impressed upon it, the only change
that is made therein, is in the situation and contexture of its
parts, which cannot give it life, sensation or perception, much
less a power of judging and willing, or being conversant about
things spiritual and immaterial.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>(2.) This power of thinking or reasoning was not derived
from the body to which it was united; for that which has not
in itself those superior endowments, cannot communicate them
to another: Its union with the soul cannot impart them to it;
for whatever sensation the body has, (which is below the power
of reasoning,) is derived from the soul, as appears from its
being wholly destitute thereof, when the union between the soul
and body is broken: And therefore, since those superior powers,
or excellencies of the soul, are produced by another cause,
we must conclude, that they are immediately from God: This
evidently appears from scripture; the body of Adam was first
formed, and then it is said, <i>God breathed into his nostrils the
breath of life</i>, Gen. ii. 7. that is, he put into it that soul which
was the spring and fountain of all living actions; and then it
follows, man became a living soul: And it is considered as a
peculiar display of the glory of God, that he <i>formeth the spirit
of man within him</i>, Zech. xii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It follows from hence, that the dissolution of the body
makes no alteration in the powers and faculties of the soul;
which is not hereby rendered subject to death. For, as it did
not derive those powers from the body, as was before observed,
it could not be said to lose them in the ruin of the body: Thus
our Saviour speaks of the soul as not being affected with those
injuries that tend to the bodies destruction, when he says, <i>Fear
not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul</i>,
Mat. x. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We have a particular account in scripture, of the soul
when separated from the body, as disposed of in a different way
from it; it does not go down to the earth as the body does,
from whence it was, but <i>returns to God who gave it</i>, Eccl. xii.
7. Its return to God supposes that it was accountable to him
for its actions performed in the body, or the way and manner
in which the faculties were exerted; and accordingly, when separate
from it, it is represented as returning to God to give an
account of its behaviour in the body, and to reap the fruits and
effects thereof. And as it is said to return to God; so believers
breathe forth their souls, and resign them by faith into the hand
of God, as our Saviour expresses it, <i>Father, into thy hands I
commend my spirit</i>, Luke xxiii. 46. or, as Stephen says, <i>Lord
Jesus receive my spirit</i>, Acts vii. 59.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) The soul’s immortality may be proved from the extent
of the capacities thereof, and the small improvement men make
of them in this world, especially the greatest part of mankind.
What a multitude are there who never had the faculties of the
soul deduced into act, in whom the powers of reasoning were
altogether useless, while in this world; I mean in those whose
souls are separated from their bodies as soon as they are born;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>others die in their childhood, before reason comes to maturity;
and how great a part of the world live to old age, whose souls
have not been employed in any thing great or excellent, in proportion
to their capacities? Were these made in vain? or did
God design, when he brought them into, or continued them
either a longer or a shorter time in the world, that they should
never be employed in any thing that is worthy of these noble
faculties? Therefore we must conclude that there is another
state, in which the soul shall act more agreeably to those capacities
which it is endowed with.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) This may be farther proved, not only from the natural
desires, which there are in all men, of immortality; but more
especially those desires, which the saints have, of enjoying some
things in God, which cannot be attained in this life. The natural
desire of immortality is what belongs to all: With what reluctancy
does the soul and body part; which arises from a natural
aversion to a dissolution, unless there be a well-grounded
hope of a life of blessedness that shall ensue? Moreover there
is not only a desire but an expectation of the soul’s living for
ever, when separated from the body, in a state of happiness;
which believers are made partakers of, as a peculiar blessing
from God: Therefore we must conclude, that he that gave them
will satisfy them; so that as they have a thirst after happiness,
which is the effect of a supernatural power, they shall not be
disappointed or destitute of it; which they must be if the soul
does not survive the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) The immortality of the soul may be proved from the
justice of God as the Governor of the world. This divine perfection
renders it necessary that rewards and punishments should
be distributed according to men’s behaviour in this life. We
observe, under a foregoing head, that man is supposed to be
accountable to God, from the consideration of the spirit’s returning
to him: And it also follows, from what was said under
another head, concerning the soul’s being the subject of moral
government: But this argument will be farther improved
under a following answer, when we consider our Saviour’s
coming to judge the world<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a>. All the use therefore that we shall
at present make thereof, is, that the soul being thus accountable
to God, has reason to expect some peculiar marks of favour
beyond what it receives in this world; or to fear some
punishment as the consequence of crimes committed, from the
hand of the supreme Judge of all: Thus it is said, <i>God will
render to every man according to his deeds</i>, Rom. ii. 6. And
elsewhere, <i>Every one shall receive according to what he hath
done in the body, whether it be good or bad</i>, 2 Cor. v. 10. Now
that which makes for our present argument, is, that the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>men in the world do not receive those peculiar marks of divine
favour, as to what respects their outward condition therein,
as some of the vilest men often do: This the prophet Jeremiah
takes notice of, when he says, <i>Righteous art thou, O Lord,
when I plead with thee; yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments:
Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore
are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</i> Jer. xii.
1. And the Psalmist, when observing the prosperity of the
wicked, says, <i>They are not in trouble like other men; neither
are they plagued like other men</i>, Psal. lxxiii. 5. that is, not exposed
to those rebukes of providence, as to what concerns outward
things, as good men are.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which is alledged by some to solve this difficulty, is,
that virtue has its own reward; and therefore, the good man
cannot but be happy, whatever troubles he meets with in this
life, since he has something within himself that makes him so.
But to this it may be replied, that this cannot give the least satisfaction,
that the divine distributions are just and equal, to
those who are destitute of this inward comfort; and the principal
ingredient in that internal happiness which arises from the
exercise of religion and virtue, consists in the divine approbation,
and the interest which such have in that love, which shall
discover itself more fully, when the soul, being separate from
the body, shall enjoy the happiness resulting from it in another
world: Therefore, this is so far from militating against the doctrine
we are maintaining, that it affords a considerable argument
to support it.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be objected also, on the other hand, that sin brings its
own punishment along with it, in that uneasiness which the
wicked find in their own breasts; concerning whom it is said,
<i>They are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest; whose waters
cast up mire and dirt</i>, Isa. lvii. 20. This also proves the
immortality of the soul; inasmuch as this fear arises from a
sense of guilt, whereby persons are liable to punishment in another
world, who are not in the least concerned about the punishment
of sin in this, and are ready to conclude themselves out
of the reach of human judicature; therefore, that which they
are afraid of, is God’s righteous judgments in another world,
which they cannot, by any means, free themselves from the
dread of. We must therefore conclude that this is as natural to
man, considered as sinful, as the hope of future blessedness is
to one that is righteous; and both these are the result of a divine
impression enstamped on the souls of men, which affords
an evident proof of their immortality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The objections against this doctrine, are generally such as
carry in them the lowest and most abject thoughts of human
nature in those who may truly be said to despise their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>souls. When they pretend, as was before observed, that they
are material, this is to set the soul on a level with the body;
for matter, how much soever it be refined, when it is resolved
into the particles of which it consists, has no excellency above
other material beings.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the objections that are brought against this doctrine
from scripture, by which the frailty of this present life is set
forth: These do not in the least tend to overthrow the immortality
of the soul. Thus, when it is said in Eccles. iii. 19, 20.
<i>That which befalleth the sons of men, befalleth beasts, even one
thing befalleth them: As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,
they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence
above a beast; all go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all
turn to dust again.</i> It is plain, that Solomon here speaks of the
inferior part of man, in which he has no pre-eminence above
the beasts, as the body is resolved into dust, as well as the bodies
of the brute creatures; but then the following words sufficiently
confute the objection, in which it is said, <i>the spirit of
man goeth upward</i>; whereby he asserts, not only the superior
excellency, but the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when it is said in chap. ix. 5. <i>The living know that
they must die, but the dead know not any thing; neither have
they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</i>
This is sufficiently answered by only reading the following
words; by which it appears, that their memory is forgotten;
and they are said to have no farther reward in this world; or,
as it is expressed, <i>They have no more any portion for ever, in
any thing that is done under the sun</i>; but this does not in the
least intimate that they have no portion in what respects the
things of another world; and, indeed, their labour being unrewarded
here, affords us an incontestible argument, that they
shall have it hereafter, when the soul leaves this world.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for other scriptures, that seem to intimate as though
death put an end to all those actions of religion which were
performed by good men in this life, as in Psal. xxx. 9. ‘When
I go down to the pit, shall the dust praise thee, shall it declare
thy truth?’ and, ‘The dead praise not the Lord; neither any
that go down into silence,’ Psal. cxv. 17. and what Hezekiah
says to the same purpose, ‘The grave cannot praise thee; death
cannot celebrate thee; they that go down to the pit cannot
hope for thy truth,’ Isa. xxxviii. 18. These and such-like expressions
intend nothing else but this; that the praises of God
cannot be celebrated by those who are in the state of the dead,
in such a way as they were by them while they lived in this
world, <i>viz.</i> in the assemblies of his saints, from which they are
separated, being no longer considered as members of the militant
church; neither are they apprized of, or affected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>things done in this lower world, in which respect they are said
to know nothing: But this does not in the least, militate against
their praising God with the church triumphant, and having
those privileges conferred upon them, which are adapted
to a state of immortality and eternal life.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is farther objected by others, that the immortality
of the soul respects only the righteous; because the apostle
says in 1 John ii. 17. ‘The world passes away, and the lust
thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.’
This sense given of the words contradicts all those scriptures
that speak of the punishment of sin in another world; for if
none are said to <i>abide for ever</i>, but the righteous, or they who
do the will of God; the wicked must necessarily go unpunished.
Therefore we must understand the word <i>abiding</i> in the
same sense as the Psalmist does, when he says, ‘The ungodly
shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
of the righteous,’ Psal. i. 5. which does not signify their
not existing in a future state, but not being admitted into the
congregation of the righteous, or made happy with them therein.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>II. We shall consider the happiness that the members of the
invisible church enjoy; which is called communion with Christ
in glory, as it includes in it perfect holiness; accordingly we
read of <i>the spirits of just men made perfect</i>, Heb. xii. 23. This
perfection consists in the rooting out all those remainders of
corruption, and those habitual inclinations to sin, that they were
never wholly freed from in this world. The most that can be
said concerning a believer at present, is, that he has a principle
of spiritual life and grace, which inclines him to oppose,
and stand his ground against, the assaults of sin that dwelleth
in him, whereby it is mortified, but not wholly destroyed. The
work of sanctification is daily growing to perfection, though it
does not fully attain to it: But when the soul leaves the world,
it arrives to perfection in a moment; so that the power which
man had at first, to yield sinless obedience, which was lost by
the fall of our first parents, is regained with great advantage.
For this perfection of holiness not only denotes a sinless state,
but the soul’s being confirmed therein; and accordingly it is
said to be received into the highest heaven, the place into which
no unclean thing can enter; where there is spotless purity, as
well as everlasting happiness; and here they are described as
beholding the face of God in light and glory. These things
need not be particularly insisted on in this place, since the
same privileges are said, in a following answer, to belong to believers
after the day of judgment, both in their souls and bodies,
when they shall be received into heaven, and be made
perfectly holy and happy, and be blest with the immediate vision
of God<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a>; Therefore all that we shall consider at present,
with relation hereunto, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the soul is immediately made partaker of this blessedness
on its separation from the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is farther described as waiting for the full redemption
of the body, which is still supposed to continue under the dominion
of death, though united to Christ, and consequently under
his special protection: Upon which account believers are
said, when they die, to rest in their graves as in their beds, till
their bodies are again united to their souls at the last day.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We shall consider that the soul is made partaker of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>blessedness immediately after its separation from the body, as
it is observed in this answer; which seems to militate against
three opinions that have been advanced relating to the state of
separate souls.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That of the Papists, who maintain that the soul is not
made perfect in holiness at death, but enters into a middle-state,
which they call purgatory, in which it is to endure exquisite
torments, designed partly as a punishment inflicted for
those sins committed in this life, which have not been expiated
by satisfaction made by them, and partly to free them from the
sin which they brought with them into that state.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Another opinion which seems to be opposed in this answer,
is what was maintained by some of the ancient Fathers;
namely, that the souls of believers do not immediately enter into
the highest heaven before they are reunited to their bodies,
but into paradise; not to suffer, as the Papists pretend that they
do who are in purgatory; but to enjoy those pleasures which
are reserved for them in a place not much inferior to heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] There is another opinion which is subversive of the doctrine
contained in this answer; namely, that the soul, at its separation
from the body, sleeps till the resurrection; and consequently,
in that intermediate space of time in which it is separate,
it is no more capable of happiness or misery than the
body that lies in the grave. The absurdity of these opinions we
shall take occasion farther to consider. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That of the Papists concerning a middle-state, into which
they suppose, souls enter at death, in order to their being cleansed
from the remainders of sin, whereby they are made meet
for heaven. This doctrine, how ludicrous and ungrounded soever
it may appear to be, they are so fond of, that it will be as
hard a matter to convince them of the absurdity thereof, as it
was of old to convince the worshippers of Diana at Ephesus,
of their stupid idolatry; because it tends to promote their secular
interest. They first endeavour to persuade the poor deluded
people, that they must suffer very great torments after
death, unless they be relieved by the prayers of their surviving
friends; and then, to induce them to shew this favour to them,
as well as that they may merit some abatement of these torments
or a speedy release from them, they tell them, that it is
their duty and interest to leave their estates, by their last will
and testament to pious uses; such as building of churches, endowing
of monasteries, &amp;c. by which means they have got a
great part of the estates of the people into their own hands.
And to carry on this cheat, they give particular instances, in
some of their writings, of souls being released from this dreadful
place by their prayers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The account they give of this middle-state, between heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>and hell, is not only that they are not admitted into the immediate
presence of God; but are exposed to grievous torments
by fire, little short of those that are endured in hell; and if
they are not helped by the prayers of the church, they are in
danger of being sent from thence directly to hell, from whence
there is no release. They also add, that the punishment, in this
state, is either longer or shorter, in proportion to the crimes
committed in this world; for which satisfaction has not been
made by penances endured, or money given to compensate for
them. Some, indeed, are allowed, by them, to pass immediately
into heaven, without being detained here; namely, those
who have performed works of supererogation; or if by their
entering into a vow of poverty, they have parted with their
estates, while living in the world, for the use of the church, in
which case no end could be answered, by telling them of this
fable of purgatory. Others are told that they may escape it,
by entering into a vow of chastity and canonical obedience;
which belongs more especially to the priests, when entering
into holy orders; whereby they take care to make provision
for themselves, that so the deluded people may have a greater
regard to their prayers, since they will find none in purgatory
to perform that service for them. This is so vile and absurd
an opinion, that it cannot but expose the church of Rome to
the scorn and contempt of all who are not given up to strong
delusions.</p>

<p class='c006'>But though it sufficiently appears, that secular interest is the
main foundation of this doctrine; yet there are some arguments,
which they take from scripture, to support it; which is
the only thing that requires our notice.</p>

<p class='c006'>One scripture brought to this purpose, is in Isa. iv. 4. where
the prophet speaks concerning the <i>Lord’s purging the blood of
Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and
by the spirit of burning</i>; supposing that this should have its
accomplishment when the soul left the body, and was detained
in this place of torment. But this is very remote from the design
of the Holy Ghost herein; for it only contains a metaphorical
description of some judgments which God would inflict
on people in this life, and as a means to reclaim them from
them: therefore we often read, in the prophets, of God’s refining
his people <i>in the furnace of affliction</i>, Isa. xlviii. 10. and
accordingly it is said, that <i>the Lord’s fire is in Zion, and his
furnace in Jerusalem</i>, chap. xxxi. 9. denoting the sore judgments
they should undergo in this world, as a punishment for
their idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another scripture, which is miserably perverted, to support
this doctrine, is that in Zech. ix. 11. <i>By the blood of thy covenant
have I sent forth thy prisoners, out of the pit wherein is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>no water</i>; which they suppose, is to be understood of some
state after this life; because it is called <i>the pit</i>; and it is also
described as a place of misery, inasmuch as there is no water,
that is, no refreshing comforts; and they add, that the prophet
does not speak of hell because some persons are described as
<i>sent forth</i>, or released from it; therefore it must needs be understood
of this middle-state, between heaven and hell. But
this is far from being the sense of the text, since it contains a
prediction of their being delivered from the Babylonish captivity,
which, in a metaphorical way of speaking, is called <i>the
pit, wherein is no water</i>, to denote the great distress that the
people were to be brought under therein; thus the prophet
Isaiah, speaking of their deliverance from the captivity, says,
<i>The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
should not die in the pit</i>, Isa. li. 14. Or else it denotes some
future deliverance, which the church was to expect after great
calamities undergone by them; and this is said to be <i>by the
blood of the covenant</i>, denoting that all the happiness the church
shall enjoy in this world, as well as the other is founded in the
blood of Christ, pursuant to the covenant of grace: and if the
text must necessarily be understood of a deliverance from evil
after death, it may be considered as a prediction of our being
delivered from eternal destruction, by the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, another scripture which they bring to support this
fabulous doctrine, is in 1 Cor. iii. 13, 14, 15. <i>Every man’s
work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every
man’s work, of what sort it is, If any man’s work abide which
he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s
work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be
saved; yet so as by fire</i>. The reason why this scripture is forced
into that cause which they maintain, is, because we read
of persons being <i>saved so as by fire</i>; and this they suppose to
respect that which should follow after the particular judgment
of every one at death in which, a scrutiny shall be made concerning
their works, or their behaviour in this world; and if
they are found faulty, they may, notwithstanding, be saved after
they have endured those sufferings which are there allotted
for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is nothing in the text that gives the least countenance
to this notion, since the apostle seems to be speaking concerning
those ministers who preach false doctrines, that is, propagate
errors not directly subversive of the fundamental articles
of faith, but such as tend to embarrass the consciences of
men, and, in many respects, lead them out of the way; or of
others, who have been perverted by them, and have embraced
pernicious errors, which, in their consequences, are subversive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>of the faith, but yet do not hold those consequences: these may
be saved, but their salvation shall be attended with some difficulty,
arising from the mistaken notions which they have imbibed.
Some compare this to a person whose house is in flames,
and he saves his life with difficulty, being scorched thereby.
God will, in his own time, take some method to discover what
notions we have received in religion; and he is said to do it by
fire. Whether this, as a learned writer observes, is to be understood
of the clear gospel-dispensation,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a> or else respects some
trying dispensation of providence, accompanied with a greater
measure of the effusion of the Spirit, that shall lead men into the
knowledge of their mistakes, and set them in the right way, I
will not determine. But whether the one or the other of these
senses of the texts seems most agreeable to the mind of the
apostle, it is sufficiently evident that no countenance is given,
either in this or any other scripture, to this absurd doctrine of
the Papists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another scripture which they bring for the proof of this doctrine,
is in 1 Pet. iii. 19. in which it is said, that our Saviour
<i>went and preached unto the spirits in prison</i>. The sense they
give of that text, compared with the foregoing verse, is, that as
our Saviour, after his death, visited those repositories, where
the Old Testament-saints were lodged, and preached the gospel
to them, which they embraced; and pursuant hereupon,
were admitted into heaven: so he went down into this subterraneous
prison, and preached to them also; but whether this
was attended with the same success, or no, they pretend not to
determine; but only allege this as a proof that there is such a
place: and to give countenance to this sense they say, that by
the prison here spoken of, the prison of hell cannot be intended;
inasmuch as there is no hope of salvation there, and consequently
no preaching of the gospel. And it cannot be meant
of his preaching to any in this world; for they suppose, that
he went after he left the world, and <i>preached to spirits</i>, that is,
to persons, whose souls were separate from their bodies; therefore
he went, as they argue, and preached to those that are in
purgatory: but in giving this sense of the text, they are obliged
to take no notice of what follows, which, if duly considered,
would plainly overthrow it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The meaning of this scripture therefore is this, that our Saviour
preached by his Spirit, to the old world, in the ministry
of Noah, while he was preparing the ark; but they being disobedient,
were not only destroyed by the flood, but shut up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>the prison of hell; in which respect it is said he preached to
those that are now in prison: so that this scripture makes nothing
for that doctrine which we are opposing; nor any other
that is or can be brought; so that all the arguments pretended
to be taken from it, are a manifest perversion thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, there is one method of reasoning which they make
use of, that I cannot pass over; inasmuch as they apprehend
that it contains a <i>dilemma</i> that is unanswerable; namely, that
there is some place in which persons are perfectly freed from
sin, which must be either this world, or heaven, or some middle
state between them both. It is allowed by all, that there is
no perfect freedom from sin in this world; and to suppose that
persons are perfectly freed from sin after they come to heaven,
is to conclude that that is a state of probation, in which the
gospel must be preached, and persons that attend upon it, inclined
to embrace it, which is not agreeable to a state of perfection:
and this is contrary to scripture, which speaks of no
unclean thing entering therein. Therefore it follows, that the
state in which they are fitted for it, must be this which they
plead for, to wit, a middle-state, in which they are first purged,
and then received into heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied, that it is true, believers are
not perfectly freed from sin in this world, nor do they enter into
heaven, either with the guilt or pollution of their sins upon
them; but they are made perfect in an instant, in passing out
of this world into heaven: the same stroke which separates
the soul from the body takes away the remainders of corruption,
and fits it for the heavenly state; it passes out of this
world perfect, though it was imperfect while in it; in like manner
as the body being raised out of the grave is rendered incorruptible
thereby, so that we have no occasion to invent a
middle state, into which the saints are brought. Therefore it
follows, as it is expressed in this answer, that the souls of
believers, immediately after death, are made perfect in holiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] There is another opinion embraced by some of the Jews,
and several of the Fathers, in which they are followed by some
modern writers; namely, that the souls of believers, at death,
enter into paradise, where they continue till they are reunited
to their bodies, and, after the day of judgment, are received
into the highest heaven: thus they understand our Saviour’s
words to the penitent thief on the cross, <i>To day thou shalt be
with me in paradise</i>, in a literal sense, as contra-distinguished
from heaven. And these assert, that the soul of our Saviour,
when separate from his body, went immediately into paradise,
and not into heaven, till after his resurrection. This is supposed
to import the same thing as <i>Abraham’s bosom</i> does in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>parable; and indeed, the Greek word,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a> in the metaphorical
sense thereof, which we translate <i>bosom</i>, signifies a port or
haven; which is, as it were, a bosom for shipping.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is described as very distinct from the Popish doctrine
of purgatory; for it is not a place of suffering, but of delight
and pleasure. Tertullian, who gave into this notion,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a> describes
it as a place of divine pleasure, designed for the reception of
the spirits of holy men, being separate either from the world,
or other places near it, by an inclosure of fire, designed to keep
the wicked out.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is what they suppose the apostle Paul speaks of when
he says, that he was <i>caught up into paradise</i>, 2 Cor. xii. 5. and
they conclude that this vision or rapture which he mentions,
includes in it what he experienced at two several times; and
that this is agreeable to what he mentions in verse 1. where he
speaks not of one single vision, but of <i>visions</i> and <i>revelations</i>.
Accordingly they suppose that he had first of all a vision of
the glory of heaven, and then he had another of paradise: thus
a late writer understands the text.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a> However, I cannot think
that this can be sufficiently inferred from the apostle’s words,
which are, as it were, a preface to introduce the account which
he gives of himself, when he says, <i>I will come to visions and
revelations</i>; that is, I will now tell you how God sometimes
favours his people with extraordinary visions and revelations:
then he proceeds to give an instance hereof in himself, as being
<i>caught up into the third heaven</i>, or into paradise; for I cannot
suppose that he speaks of two visions, or distinguishes paradise
from heaven; and therefore I am obliged not to pay that deference
to the sentiments of the Fathers he mentions, as he
does, but must conclude the notion to be altogether ungrounded,
though it is supported by the credit of Irenæus, Tertullian,
Epiphanius, Methodius, as well as of several Jewish writers;
such as Philo, and some others,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] We shall now consider another doctrine, maintained by
some, which is inconsistent with what is said in this answer,
concerning the souls of believers being made perfect in holiness,
and entering immediately into heaven, when separate
from their bodies, <i>viz.</i> that at death the soul sleeps as well as
the body, till the resurrection, when one shall be raised, and
the other awakened out of its sleep. These do not suppose that
the soul ceases to exist; but that it enters into, and continues
in, a state of inactivity, without any power to exercise the faculty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>of thinking, and, as a consequence thereof, whilst remaining
in this state, it must be incapable either of happiness or misery.
These do not assert that there shall be no rewards and punishments
in a future state; but that there will be a deferring thereof
until the last day.</p>

<p class='c006'>This doctrine was generally maintained by the Socinians, as
may be seen in several of their writings referred to by a learned
author, who opposes them;<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and the arguments by which it is
usually supported, are taken partly from the possibility of the
soul’s being destitute of thought, and partly from those scriptures
that compare death to a sleep; by which they understand
not only a cessation of action in the body, but likewise in the
soul. In defence of the former of these, <i>viz.</i> that it is possible
for the soul to be without the exercise of thought, they argue,
that the soul of a new-born infant, (or, at least, before it is
born,) has no ideas: though there be a power of reasoning,
which is essential, to the soul; yet this is not deduced into act,
so as to produce thought, or actual reasoning, from whence
moral good or evil would proceed, and a sense of happiness or
misery, arise from it. And this notion is carried somewhat
farther by a late celebrated writer;<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a> who, though he takes no
notice of the tendency of his assertion to support this opinion
concerning the soul’s sleeping at death; yet others make a handle
of it, to defend it with a greater shew of reason than what
was formerly discovered in maintaining this argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>He asserts, that the souls of those that are adult do not always
think; and particularly when a person is in a sound sleep,
that he has no thought; how much soever there may be the
exercise of thought, though confused and irregular, in those
who, between sleeping and waking, not only dream a thousand
things which they never thought of before, but also remember
those dreams when they awake. That a person, in a sound sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>has no dreams, and consequently is destitute of thought, he attempts
to prove; inasmuch as when any one is suddenly waked
out of a sound sleep, he can give no account of what he had
been thinking of; and he supposes it impossible for a person
who was thinking, to forget the next moment what his thoughts
were conversant about. This is the principal argument whereby
he supports this notion; and he has so far the advantage
thereof, as that it is impossible for us to prove the contrary
from any thing that we know or experience concerning ourselves:
Nevertheless, it will not appear very convincing, when
we consider that there are innumerable thoughts which we have
when awake, that we can hardly give an account of the next
minute: And if the thoughts are very active in those that
dream, (who are as much asleep as others that do not dream;
though the sleep may not be so refreshing as if it were otherwise,)
I cannot see how this consequence can be inferred, that
sleep is inconsistent with thought. Moreover, a person who is
delirious, or distracted, undoubtedly thinks, though his thoughts
are disordered; but when the <i>delirium</i> or distraction is over,
he can no more remember what he thought of, than a person
that is waked out of the soundest sleep: This argument therefore
tends rather to amuse, or embarrass the cause they maintain,
than to give sufficient conviction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now from this method of reasoning it is inferred, that when
the soul is separated from the body, it is altogether destitute of
the exercise of thought, which is what they mean by the soul’s
sleeping: And to give farther countenance to this matter, they
produce several scriptures, in which death is compared to a
sleep; as when God speaks of the death of Moses, he says,
<i>Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers</i>, Deut. xxxi. 26. and
Job speaks of <i>sleeping in the dust</i>, Job vii. 21. And concerning
the resurrection after death, he says, <i>That man lieth down
and riseth not, till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake
nor be raised out of their sleep</i>, chap. xiv. 12. and David prays,
<i>Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death</i>, Psal. xiii. 3.
and our Saviour, speaking concerning Lazarus, when dead,
says, <i>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake
him out of sleep</i>, John xi. 11. which he afterwards explains, ver.
14. when he says, <i>Lazarus is dead</i>. There are several other
scriptures to the like purpose, they bring to prove that the soul
sleeps in death, taking the word in the literal sense thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied, that as to what respects the
possibility of the soul’s being rendered incapable of thinking,
when separate from the body; it is no just way of reasoning to
infer from the possibility of a thing, the actual being of it:
Therefore if it could be proved to a demonstration, (as the author
above-mentioned supposes he has done, though, I think,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>without sufficient ground,) that sleep deprives a person of
thought; yet it will not follow from hence, that the soul, when
separate from the body, ceases to think. When the powers and
faculties of the soul are deduced into act, experience tells us,
that they are greatly improved and strengthened; and therefore
the exercise thereof cannot be so easily impeded as is pretended;
especially when we consider that it does not derive this
from the body, which contributes very little to those ideas it
has of things immaterial, which are not the objects of sense;
and how much soever bodily diseases may weaken or interrupt
the soul in its actings, we do not find that they so far destroy
those powers, but that, when the distemper ceases, the former
actings return, like the spring of a watch, which may be stopped
by something that hinders the motion of the wheels, which,
when it is removed, continues to give motion to them as it had
done before: The body, at most, can be considered but as a
clog and impediment to the activity of the soul; and consequently
it may be argued from thence, that in a state of separation
the soul is so far from being impeded in its actings, that
it becomes more active than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which I would principally insist on, as what will
sufficiently overthrow this doctrine, is, the account which we
have in many scriptures; and several just consequences which
may be deduced from them, by which it will appear, that nothing
that has been said concerning the possibility of the soul’s
being unactive, when separate from the body, can enervate the
force of the argument taken from thence to support the contrary
doctrine. It is true, the scripture oftentimes represents
death as a <i>sleep</i>, as in the places before-mentioned; and it is
sometimes described as a state of rest, which is of the same
import with sleep; but this is explained as a state of peace,
holiness, and happiness, and not a cessation from action. Thus
it is said, <i>He shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their beds,
each one walking in his uprightness</i>, Isa. lvii. 2. which is plainly
meant of the death of the righteous, as appears from the
preceding verse, where it is said, <i>The righteous perisheth, and
no man layeth it to heart</i>. Now these are said to <i>enter into
peace</i>; which supposes that they are capable of the enjoyment
of those blessings which the soul shall then be possessed of, and
they are said to <i>walk in their uprightness</i>; which signifies their
being active in what respects the glory of God, which is very
inconsistent with the soul’s sleeping, when separate from the
body. Rest and sleep are metaphorical expressions, when applied
to this doctrine; and nothing is more common than for
such figurative ways of speaking to be used in the sacred writings;
and therefore it is very absurd for us to understand the
words otherwise in this instance before us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>We will now proceed to consider those proofs we have from
scripture, of the soul’s being in a state of activity when separate
from the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first scripture that may be brought to prove this, is what
the apostle says in 2 Cor. xii. 2, 3, 4. when speaking concerning
himself as <i>caught up into the third heaven</i>; and not knowing
whether he was at the same time, <i>in, or out of the body</i>.
If he was in the body, his senses were locked up, and he must
be supposed to have been in a trance; which militates against
the supposition that the soul’s power of acting may be impeded
either by sleep or some bodily disease, in which there is not
the exercise of the senses. Or if, on the other hand, he was
<i>out of the body</i>, his <i>hearing unspeakable words</i> plainly proves
our argument, <i>viz.</i> that the soul is capable of action, and consequently
of enjoying the heavenly glory, when separate from
the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this is evident from our Saviour’s words to the
penitent thief on the cross, <i>Verily I say unto thee, to day shalt
thou be with me in paradise</i>, Luke xxiii. 43. To <i>be in paradise</i>
is certainly to be in heaven in a state of compleat blessedness,
where the soul delights itself in the enjoyment of God, which
is altogether inconsistent with a state of insensibility. Were it
otherwise, it ought rather to have been said, thou shalt be with
me in paradise after the resurrection of the body, than to day.
The method which some take to evade the force of the argument,
who say, that <i>to day</i>, refers not to the time of his being
admitted into heaven, but to the time when Christ spake these
words, is so low and trifling, that it doth not deserve an answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another scripture which fully proves this doctrine,
namely, what the apostle says, <i>I am in a strait betwixt two,
having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far
better</i>, Phil. i. 23. In which he takes it for granted, that as soon
as he departed out of this world, he should be with Christ;
which denotes that he should be in his immediate presence, beholding
his glory; which is inconsistent with the supposition
that the soul sleeps at death. And this is farther evident from
what he says, that this is <i>far better</i>, which could not be said
to be, if the notion we are opposing were true; for it is so much
better for a saint to be serving Christ’s interest in this world,
and made so eminently useful in promoting his glory, as the
apostle was, than to be in a state of inactivity, wherein the soul
is not capable of doing any thing for him, nor enjoying any
thing from him, that there is no comparison between them;
and whereas he was <i>in a strait</i> which of these two he should
chuse, had it been referred to him, the matter might easily have
been determined in favour of his continuing in this world; for
there he was useful; whereas, in the other, he would not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>be useless, but incapable of enjoying those privileges which he
was made partaker of here.</p>

<p class='c006'>My next argument shall be taken from what is said in 2 Cor.
v. 8. <i>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent
from the body, and to be present with the Lord</i>; where one infers
the other, without any intimation of his waiting till the soul
is united again to the body, before he is admitted into Christ’s
presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, this farther appears from the words of Solomon, in
Eccl. iv. 2. <i>I praised the dead which are already dead, more
than the living which are yet alive.</i> By which we are to understand,
that the state of believers, when they die, is much more
happy than it can be in this life; which supposes that they are
capable of happiness, and consequently that the soul, when separated
from the body, is not in a state of insensibility; which
is altogether inconsistent with happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to all this we may add what our Saviour says in the parable
of the rich man and Lazarus; the <i>beggar died, and was
carried by angels into Abraham’s bosom: The rich man also died
and was buried, and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments</i>,
Luke xvi. 22, 23. In which parable we have an account
of the different state of the souls of the righteous and wicked
at death, and not barely what shall follow upon the resurrection
of the body; for when the rich man is represented as being
in torments, he says, in a following part of the parable, <i>I
have five brethren</i>; and he would have <i>had Lazarus sent to
testify to them, lest they should also come into that place of torment</i>;
to which it is replied, <i>They have Moses and the prophets,
let them hear them</i>, ver. 28, 29. which plainly intimates, that
the parable refers to the state of separate souls, before the resurrection,
whilst others enjoyed the means of grace; and consequently
it proves that the soul, when separate from the body,
is capable of happiness or misery; and which is more, is
fixed in one or the other of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to those scriptures that speak of the happiness or misery
of men, as deferred to the end of the world. It is intimated in
the parable of the tares, that <i>the angels shall come forth, and
sever the wicked from the just</i>, Mat. xiii. 9. and the former are
said to be <i>cast into a furnace of fire</i>, ver. 49, 50. and the latter,
<i>viz.</i> the righteous, to <i>shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father</i>, ver. 43. which respects the dealings of God with
man, in the end of time. Moreover our Saviour speaks of his
people as <i>blessed and recompensed at the resurrection of the just</i>,
Luke xiv. 14. And the apostle Paul expresses his hope of a
<i>crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
should give him at that day</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 8. that is, the day of
his coming to judgment; and several other scriptures that speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>of what is consequent to the resurrection. To this it may be replied,
that these scriptures respect not the beginning, but consummation
of the happiness of the saints, or their compleat blessedness
in soul and body, which is not inconsistent with the
happiness that separate souls enjoy before the resurrection.
Nor is the misery that is consequent upon the resurrection, inconsistent
with that which sinners endure before it, when their
souls are separate from their bodies. Thus concerning the happiness
of the souls of believers at death; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. What is farther observed in this answer, concerning the
soul’s waiting for the full redemption of the body; which
though it continues under the dominion of death, is notwithstanding
united to Christ; and accordingly believers are said
to rest in their graves as in their beds, till the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The souls of believers are described as waiting for the full
redemption of their bodies; which is the same expression that
the apostle uses, Rom. viii. 23. where redemption denotes a full
discharge from that prison, or state of confinement in the grave;
in which the body was rendered incapable of answering the end
for which it was redeemed by Christ, and, at the same time,
the soul was destitute of that happiness which its re-union
therewith shall convey to it. Its enjoyments were all spiritual,
and, in their kind perfect; but yet it was naked, or, as the apostle
expresses it unclothed; inasmuch as it wanted that which
was designed to be a constituent part, necessary to compleat
the human nature; without which it was indisposed for those
actions and enjoyments which arise from its union with the body.
This it is said to wait for, as a desire of re-union therewith
is natural to it. Nevertheless it waits without impatience,
or any diminution of its intellectual happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As to what respects the bodies of believers, they are
said to continue united to Christ, which is the result of their
being redeemed by him, and of his condescending to dwell in
them by his Spirit. Accordingly his love extends itself to their
lower part, as well as to their souls; and, as the apostle says,
<i>Nothing shall separate</i> a believer <i>from his love</i>, no, <i>not death
itself</i>, ver. 38, 39. upon which account they are said to <i>sleep in
Jesus</i>, 1 Thes. iv. 14. or to <i>die in the Lord</i>, Rev. xiv. 14.
They are indeed buried in the grave, and seem to lie neglected
like common dust: nevertheless it is said, <i>Precious in the sight
of the Lord is the death of his saints</i>, Psal. cxvi. 15. Christ
reckons every particle of their dust among <i>his jewels</i>, Mal. iii.
17. and is no more ashamed to own them as his peculiar care,
than he was when they were in their most flourishing state in
this world; and for this reason they are also said to rest in their
graves as in their beds. This is a scripture-expression, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Psalmist says, <i>My flesh shall rest in hope</i>, Psal. xvi. 9. and the
prophet Isaiah, <i>He shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their
beds</i>, Isa. lvii. 2. The body, indeed, remains, at the same time,
under the external part of the curse due to man for sin; yet it
is freed from that which is the most bitter ingredient therein;
which will be abundantly demonstrated when death shall be
compleatly swallowed up in victory. In this the bodies of believers
have the advantage of all others. The frame of nature
indeed is dissolved; there is no visible mark of distinction from
the wicked put upon them in the grave; yet there is a vast difference
in God’s account, which one elegantly compares to the
removing of the tabernacle in the wilderness: when the Israelites
changed their stations, all the parts thereof were carefully
taken down and delivered to the Levites’ charge, in order to
its being raised again with honour; whereas, the house incurably
infected with the leprosy, was plucked down with violence,
and thrown into an unclean place with execration. The
bodies of the saints are committed to the bosom of the earth, as
the repository Christ has appointed for them; from whence he
will call them forth at last, when their souls shall be again united
to them in the glorious morning of the resurrection. This
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The misery which the souls of the wicked endure at
death, which is contained in the latter part of this answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have here a different scene opened, the final estate of the
wicked described in words adapted to strike dread and terror
into those who have, at present, no sense of their future misery:
their souls are considered as cast into, or shut up in hell;
their bodies imprisoned in the grave, and both, the objects of
divine wrath. We shall have occasion, under a following answer,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
farther to speak concerning the punishment that shall
be inflicted on sinners, whose torments shall be inexpressible,
both in body and soul, after the day of judgment: and therefore
we shall, at present, consider the misery which the souls
of the wicked shall undergo before they are united to their bodies.
The soul, which carries out of the world with it the power
of reflecting on itself as happy or miserable, immediately sees
itself separate from the comfortable presence of God, the fountain
of blessedness. And that which tends to enhance its misery
beyond what it is capable of in this life, will be the enlargement
of its faculties; as the apprehension shall be more clear
and its sensation of the wrath of God more pungent; when it
is not oppressed with that drowsiness and stupidity as it was
before; nor will it be possible for it to delude itself, with those
vain hopes, which it once conceived, of escaping that misery,
which it is now plunged into; when all the waves and billows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of the Almighty shall overwhelm and swallow it up. The soul
is, in a peculiar manner, the subject of misery, as it is made
uneasy by its own thoughts; which are compared to the worm
that dieth not. While it looks backwards, and calls to mind the
actions of his past life, and all his sins are charged upon him,
this fills it with such a sense of guilt and confusion as is inexpressibly
tormenting; and when he looks forward, there is nothing
but what administers despair, which increases his misery
to the highest degree. These torments the soul endures before
it is reunited to the body, and thereby rendered receptive of
others, which we generally call the punishment of sense, that
are conveyed by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The place of punishment is the same that is allotted for soul
and body, <i>viz.</i> hell; and this is called utter darkness; which is
an expression used to signify the greatest degree of misery.
As for their bodies, they dread the thoughts of being united to
them again; inasmuch as that will bring with it new accessions
of torment. These are considered as liable to a double dishonour;
not only that which arises from their being in a state
of corruption in common with all mankind; but in their being
detained in the grave, as prisoners to the justice of God, from
whence they shall not be released as persons acquitted or discharged,
but remanded from that prison to another, from
whence there is no deliverance. But more of this under a following
answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-87' class='c003'>Quest. LXXXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXVII.</span> <i>What are we to believe concerning the
resurrection?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We are to believe, that at the last day there shall be a
general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust;
when they that are then found alive, shall, in a moment, be
changed; and the self-same bodies of the dead which were
laid in the grave, being then again united to their souls for
ever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ; the bodies
of the just, by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his resurrection,
as their head, shall be raised in power, spiritual,
incorruptible, and made like to his glorious body; and the
bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonour, by him,
as an offended Judge.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the foregoing answers, we have considered the soul and
body as separated by death, the body turned to corruption,
and the soul immediately entering into a state of happiness or
misery; and are now led to insist on the doctrine of the resurrection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>when these two constituent parts of man shall be reunited.
And accordingly we shall endeavour,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To explain what we are to understand by the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall prove that there is nothing in this doctrine contrary
to reason, at least, if we consider it as a supernatural and
divine work.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We shall farther observe, that this doctrine could not
be known by the light of nature; and therefore we believe it
as founded in divine revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. What arguments are contained in scripture for the proof
thereof; some of which might be taken from the Old Testament,
and others from the New, in which it is more clearly
revealed.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We shall answer some of the most material objections
brought against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. We shall consider it as universal, as it is here styled a
general resurrection of the dead, from the beginning of time to
Christ’s second coming; yet with this exception, that they who
are found alive shall be changed. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. The condition in which the body shall be raised; and
those circumstances of honour and glory, which respect, more
especially, the resurrection of the just. And, on the other hand,
we shall consider the resurrection of the wicked, as being in
dishonour, by Christ, as an offended Judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What are we to understand by the resurrection of the
dead. We sometimes find the word taken, in scripture, in a
metaphorical sense, for God’s doing those things for his church,
which could not be brought about any otherwise than by his
extraordinary and supernatural power. Sometimes the work of
regeneration is set forth by this figurative way of speaking;
whereby they who are dead in trespasses and sins, are said to
be quickened; and our Saviour speaks of this when he says,
<i>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live</i>, John v.
25. But we are to understand it in a proper sense, as denoting
that change which shall pass upon the body, when it shall be
delivered from the state of corruption, into which it was
brought at death, and reunited to the soul; which is distinguished
in a following verse, from this metaphorical sense of
it, when he says, <i>All that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection
of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of
damnation</i>, ver. 28. This includes in it not barely the repairing,
but the rebuilding the frame of nature; which was not only decayed,
but dissolved in death; or the gathering together those
particles of matter, of which the body was before constituted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>which was not only turned into corruption, but common dust;
whereby a new body, as to the form and qualities thereof, is
erected out of its old materials; otherwise it could not be called
a resurrection. It is said, indeed, that the body shall not, in all
respects, be the same that it was when separated from the soul;
as the apostle compares to a <i>grain of wheat</i> sown in the
ground, which, when it springs up, is not altogether the same
as it was before; for <i>God giveth it a body,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a> as it hath pleased
him, and to every seed his own body</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 37, 38. It is the
same for substance, as it consists of the same materials, but
very different as to its qualities; as will be farther considered,
when we speak concerning the condition of the body when
raised from the dead; and as it is raised with a design that it
should be re-united to the soul, which will immediately follow
upon it; and this union shall be indissoluble and eternal.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall now consider that there is nothing contrary to
reason, or impossible, from the nature of the thing, which might
have a tendency to overthrow this doctrine; especially if we
consider it as a supernatural and divine work, brought about
by the almighty power of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we look no farther than the power of natural causes, we
may conclude it to be impossible for a creature to effect, as
much as it was at first to produce the body of man out of the
dust of the ground; but this is not impossible with God: He
that gave life and being to all things; and, by his sovereign
will, puts a period to that life, which had been, for some time
continued by his power and providence, can give a new life to
it; especially if there be nothing in this work that renders it
unmeet for it to be performed by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>That there is nothing in the nature of the thing that renders
a resurrection impossible, appears, in that death, though it be
a dissolution of the frame of nature, does not annihilate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>body. If the body, indeed, were annihilated at death, then it
would be impossible, or contrary to the nature of things, that
there should be a resurrection thereof; since the bringing it
again into a state of existence would be a new creation; which,
though it would not be too great a work for omnipotency, yet
it could not be styled a resurrection, or restoring the same body
to life that was separated from the soul, to which it was once
united. But when we suppose that the matter of which the body
consisted is still in being, and nothing is necessary to the
raising it from the dead but the recollecting the various particles
thereof, and forming it again into a body, fitted to receive
the soul: this is not in its own nature impossible; nor does it
infer a contradiction, so as that we should argue from thence,
that it cannot be brought about by divine power.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this may more fully appear, let it be considered, that
nothing which God has brought into being, can be annihilated,
but by an act of his will; since nothing can defeat or disannul
his providence, which upholdeth all things that were brought
into being by the word of his power. It is also certain, that God
has given us no ground to conclude that any part of his material
creation has been, or shall be turned into nothing; from
whence it follows, that the particles of all the bodies of men,
that once lived in this world, though turned to corruption or
dust, are as much in being as ever they were, though not in
the same form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is certain that God, who made and upholdeth all
things, has a perfect knowledge of that which is the object of
his power, since his understanding is infinite: therefore he
knows where the scattered dust, or the smallest particles of
matter that once constituted the bodies of men, are reserved:
and when we speak of a resurrection from the dead, we understand
hereby the gathering them together, and disposing
them in such a way as that new bodies shall be framed out of
them: therefore, though this could not be done by any but
God, it is not impossible, from the nature of the thing, for him
to do it; and that he will do it will be considered, when we
come more directly to the proof of this doctrine. We shall
therefore proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. To consider it as a matter of pure revelation, such as
we could not have known by the light of nature, without the
assistance of scripture-light. Something, indeed, might be
known by reason concerning the immortality of the soul, and
its being not only capable of happiness or misery in a future
state, but dealt with therein according to its behaviour in this
world: nevertheless, when we enquire into that part, which
the body shall bear therein; whether it shall be raised and reunited
to the soul, to be for ever a partner with it in what respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>its state in another world, or shall remain for ever in
a state of corruption; this cannot be known by the light of
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are, indeed, many things which we find in the writings
of the Heathen, that discover them to have had some notion of
what bears a resemblance to a resurrection: as when they speak
concerning the transmigration of souls, or their living in other
bodies, when separated from those which they formerly were
united to. And others of them speak concerning the general
conflagration, and the restoration of all things, immediately after,
to their former state, as well as give some hints which are
contained in their writings, concerning particular persons that
have been raised from the dead, at least, pretended to have
been so. What we find of this nature therein, very much resembles
the fabulous account we have in the Popish legends of
miracles, said to have been wrought, though without proof:
thus we are told of one Aristeas, the Proconnesian, who had
a power of expiring and returning to life at pleasure, and relating
what he had seen in a separate state.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a> The same is reported
of one Hermotimus of Clazomena.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a> But the most famous
story of this kind, is what is related by Plato,<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a> and transcribed
from him by Eusebius,<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a> concerning one Er, the son of
Armenius; who, after he was slain in battle, and had continued
ten days among other dead bodies, was brought home to his
house; and two days after, being laid on his funeral pile, came
to life again: this Plato, while he is relating it, calls little better
than a fable.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a> And it was treated by others with ridicule,
how much soever believed by some who regarded reports more
than solid evidence of the truth thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might also mention others, who are said, by Heathen writers
to have been translated into heaven in their bodies and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>souls<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a>: Which might take its first rise from what they had received
by tradition, concerning the translation of Enoch and
Elijah; as the stories of those that were raised from the dead
might be first invented by them with this view, that their religion
might have as great reputation as that of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c006'>But notwithstanding these particular instances related by
them, of some translated, or others raised from the dead; there
were very few of them that believed the doctrine of the resurrection;
and some treated it with as much contempt as we do
the before-mentioned account which they give of particular
persons raised from the dead<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a>. This agrees very well with
what we read in scripture, concerning the treatment the apostle
Paul met with, when he encountered the Epicureans and
Stoicks at Athens, <i>preaching to them Jesus and the resurrection</i>,
Acts xvii. 18. upon which occasion they call him <i>babbler</i>;
and insinuated that he seemed to be <i>a setter forth of strange
gods</i>. Oecumenius and Chrysostom think, that they supposed
he reckoned the <i>resurrection</i> among the gods<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a>, as well as <i>Jesus</i>,
whose divinity he doubtless maintained; but whether they
were so stupid as thus to wrest his words, is not material. It
is no wonder to find the Epicureans treating this doctrine with
ridicule; for they, denying the immortality of the soul, could
not entertain the least idea of the resurrection of the body in
any sense: Whereas the Stoicks, though they did not own the
doctrine of the resurrection, yet they could not think it so
strange a doctrine as some others might do; since they held
that the soul, after death, continued at least, as long as the
body; and they knew very well, that many of the philosophers
strenuously maintained the transmigration of souls; and, indeed,
this was held by many of them, as well as the Platonists
and Pythagoreans; and therefore the resurrection, though it
differed from it, could not seem so strange and unheard of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>notion, as that they should reckon it among the gods: However,
it plainly appears from hence that this doctrine could not
be learned by the light of nature; whatever confused ideas the
Heathen might have entertained by tradition, concerning it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore it follows from hence, that we must look for a satisfactory
account hereof from scripture: Thus when the Sadducees
put a stupid question to our Saviour concerning the
<i>woman</i> that had <i>seven husbands</i>, which successively <i>died</i>; and
they would know whose <i>wife she should be in the resurrection</i>;
by which they designed to express their opposition to this doctrine,
rather than a desire of information as to the question
proposed: Our Saviour in his reply to them refers them to the
<i>scriptures</i>, Matt. xxii 29. as the fountain from whence a clear
and satisfactory knowledge of this doctrine is to be derived as
well as from the <i>power of God</i>. This divine perfection argues
the possibility thereof, the justice and goodness of God, its expediency;
but the scriptures, which contain a revelation of his
will, represent it as certain; and this leads us to consider some
arguments that are contained in, or deduced from scripture for
the proof thereof; and here we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Those proofs which we have for it, taken from the Old
Testament. These I chuse first to insist on, because I am
sensible there are many who think, that the church knew nothing
of it, till it was revealed, by our Saviour, in the New
Testament: This very much detracts from the importance of
the doctrine, as well as renders the state of those who lived before
Christ’s incarnation, very uncomfortable, since the saints,
according to this opinion, must have had no hope of a glorious
resurrection to eternal life. This notion is defended by many
who extend the darkness of the dispensation farther than what
is convenient; and among others, it is generally maintained by
the Socinians, probably with this design, that since according
to them, our Saviour had little else in view, in coming into the
world, but to lead men into the knowledge of some things
which they were ignorant of before; this might be reckoned
one of those doctrines that he came to communicate. Thus
Volkelius denies that there were any promises of eternal life
made to the church under the Old Testament; and concludes
that there was no one who had the least surmise that any such
doctrine was contained in those scriptures which we commonly
bring from thence to prove it<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a>. And to give countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>to this opinion, several quotations are often taken from Jewish
writers, since our Saviour’s time, who either speak doubtfully
of this matter, or give occasion to think that they did not understand
those scriptures which establish the doctrine of the resurrection
in the Old Testament, as having any reference to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore it may not be amiss for us to enquire; what were
the sentiments of some of the Jews about this matter? Every
one knows that there was one <i>sect</i> amongst them, namely, the
Sadducees, who distinguished themselves from others by denying
it: And Josephus gives the largest account of any one,
concerning another <i>sect</i>, to wit, the Essens, who affected to
lead a recluse life, in their respective colleges, and were governed
by laws peculiar to themselves: Among other things
which he relates concerning their conduct and sentiments, he
says, that it was an opinion established among them, that the
bodies of men were corruptible, and the matter of which they
were compounded, not perpetual; though the soul remained
for ever: And then he represents them as speaking, according
to the Pythagorean and Platonick way, concerning the body’s
being the prison of the soul, and its remaining when released
from it, and of the soul’s dwelling in a pleasant place, and enjoying
many things that tend to make it happy, &amp;c.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a>. Nevertheless,
his account of them is so short, and the expression
on which the whole stress of this supposition is founded, a little
ambiguous, namely, that the bodies of men are corruptible, and
their matter not perpetual, which may be understood as agreeing
with the common faith concerning man’s mortality, and the
body’s turning to corruption, and not remaining in the same
state in which it was; that it seems to leave the matter doubtful,
whether they asserted or denied the resurrection. It is
also supposed, that Philo denied this doctrine from several passages
observed in his writings, which a late learned writer takes
notice of<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a>; but this is only the opinion of a single person, who,
according to his general character, seems to be halting between
two opinions, to wit, the doctrine of Moses, and the philosophy
of Plato; and therefore I take his sentiments, about this,
to be nothing else but an affection of thinking or speaking agreeably
to the Platonic philosophy, which had probably given
such a tincture to his notions, that he might deny the resurrection.
And if the Essens, before-mentioned, should be allowed
to have denied it, they received it from their attachment to the
same, or, at least, the Pythagorean philosophy: But we cannot
from hence conclude that the doctrine of the resurrection
was denied by the main body of the Jews, or the greatest part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>of them; or by any, excepting those who were led out of the
way, by the writings of the philosophers: Which gave occasion
to the apostle Paul to warn the church to <i>beware of philosophy
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments
of the world, and not after Christ</i>, Col. ii. 8. as foreseeing
that some of them, in after-ages, would, in many respects,
corrupt the doctrines of the gospel, by accommodating them to,
or explaining them by what they found in the writings of the
Heathen philosophers, as Origen, Justin Martyr, and some
others did; and he seems to take the hint from what had been
before observed relating to the corruption of the Jewish <i>faith</i>,
by those who were attached to them. Thus concerning the
opinion of those Jews, who are supposed to deny the doctrine
of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, there are several Rabbinical writers,
who sufficiently intimate their belief of this doctrine; though
it is true, some of them infer it from such premises, as discover
great weakness in their method of reasoning. Thus the
learned bishop Pearson observes, that they produce several places
out of Moses’s writings, which when the resurrection is
believed, may, in some kind, serve to illustrate it, but can, in
no degree, be thought to reveal so great a mystery<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a>. And
Dr. Lightfoot produces other proofs, which they bring for this
doctrine, as little to the purpose<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a>, of which all the use that can
be made is, that we may from hence observe, that they believed
the doctrine we are maintaining, to be contained in scripture.
Whether they were able to defend it by shewing the
force of those arguments on which it is founded therein or no,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>is not much to our present purpose, my design in referring to
their writings being to prove that this doctrine was embraced
by the Jews, in the ages before, as well as since our Saviour’s
time. It is true, the Talmud, and other writings, which are
generally quoted for the proof of it, are of later date, and the
most ancient of the Chaldee paraphrases now extant, is supposed
to have been written about that time, or, at least, but little
before it: And there are no uninspired writings, relating to the
Jewish affairs, more ancient, except those which we generally
call Apocryphal; which most suppose to have been written about
150 years before the Christian Æra. And it is very evident,
that about that time the doctrine of the resurrection was
believed by the Jewish church; as the author of the book of
Maccabees, in the history of the martyrdom of the seven brethren
in the reign of Antiochus<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a>, represents some of them in the
agonies of death, as expressing the firm belief they had of a
resurrection to eternal life; their mother, in the mean while,
encouraging them from the same consideration. These, as it
is more than probable, the apostle includes in the number of
those noble Old Testament worthies who were <i>tortured, not
accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection</i>,
Heb. xi. 35. which is an undeniable evidence that the
church at that time believed the doctrine of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that I shall add under this head is, that how weak soever
the reasoning of some Jewish writers, concerning this subject,
has been, there are others who give substantial proofs
from the Old Testament; which not only argues that they believed
it, but that their belief proceeded from a just conviction
of the truth thereof. And they give the same sense of some
of those scriptures which are generally produced for the proof
hereof, as we do<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first scripture that we shall take notice of, is what contains
the <i>vision</i> mentioned in Ezek. xxxvii. 1, <i>&amp; seq.</i> concerning
the <i>valley which was full of bones</i>, which were <i>very dry</i>:
Upon which occasion God says, <i>Son of man, Can these bones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>live?</i> to which he replies, <i>O Lord God, thou knowest.</i> And afterwards
we read of God’s <i>laying sinews, and bringing up flesh
upon them, covering them with skin, and putting breath into
them</i>; and their being hereupon restored to life. I am sensible
that they who are on the other side of the question, pretend
that this is no proof of a resurrection; because the design thereof
was to illustrate and make way for the prediction mentioned
in the following verses, concerning the deliverance of God’s
people from the Babylonish captivity: But that which seems
to have its weight with me is, that God would never have
made use of a similitude to lead them into this doctrine, taken
from a thing which they had no manner of idea of: But if we
suppose that they believed that there shall be a resurrection of
the dead, agreeable to the literal sense of the words here made
use of to illustrate it, then the argument taken from thence
is plain and easy, <i>q. d.</i> as certainly as you have ground to believe
that the dead shall be raised at the last day (which though
it could not be brought about by any natural means, yet it shall
be effected by the power of God;) so your deliverance, how
unlikely soever it may appear to those who look no farther than
second causes, shall come to pass by God’s extraordinary power
and providence, which will be as life from the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>And whereas it is farther objected, that when God asked the
prophet, whether <i>these dry bones could live</i>? He seems to be
in doubt about it; which argues that he had no idea of the resurrection
of the dead. To this it may be replied, that his doubt
respected an event that should immediately ensue; he knew
that God could put life into these bones; but whether he would
do it now or no, he could not tell: Therefore it does not contain
any disbelief of the doctrine of the resurrection at the last
day; and, indeed, this scripture, how little soever it may seem
to some to make for the doctrine we are maintaining, is alleged
by others, as an undeniable proof of it. Tertullian expressly
says, that this would have been a very insignificant vision, if
this doctrine were not true<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a>. And Jerome speaks to the same
purpose, supposing that God would never illustrate any truth
which they were in doubt of, by a similitude taken from an incredible
fiction<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a>. And Menasseh Ben Israel, a learned Jew,
supposes this text to be an express and infallible proof of the
resurrection; which plainly argues that he thought the Jews,
in former ages, were convinced of this doctrine thereby<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>But supposing this scripture be not reckoned sufficient to
evince the truth of this doctrine, there is another which has
more weight in it, <i>viz.</i> that in Job xix. 25-27. <i>I know that
my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth: And though, after my skin, worms destroy this
body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself,
and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my
reins be consumed within me.</i> Job, as is generally supposed,
lived in Moses’ time; therefore, if it can be made appear that
he professes his faith in the doctrine of the resurrection, we
may conclude that the church was acquainted with it in the
early ages thereof; and nothing seems more evident, from the
plain sense of the words, than that he here professes his faith
in, and encourages himself from the hope of future blessedness,
both in soul and body, at Christ’s second coming in the last day.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is with a great deal of difficulty that they who deny this
doctrine, are obliged to account for the sense of this text, so as
to evade the force of the argument taken from thence to prove
it. These suppose that Job intends nothing hereby but a firm
persuasion which he had, that he should be recovered from that
state of misery in which he then was, which not only affected
his mind, but his body, as it was <i>smitten with sore boils, from
the sole of his foot unto his crown</i>, Job ii. 7. <i>his flesh</i> being <i>clothed
with worms</i>, and his <i>skin broken and become loathsome</i>,
chap. vii. 5. and accordingly he says, I shall be redeemed from
this affliction, and brought into a happy state before I die; and
so they suppose that the words are to be taken in a metaphorical
sense; and therefore do not prove the doctrine of the resurrection.
But this will appear to be a very great perversion
of the sense of this text, if we consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In how solemn a manner he brings it in, in the verses
immediately foregoing. <i>Oh that my words were now written!
Oh that they were printed in a book! that they were graven
with an iron pen and lead, in the rock for ever!</i> Which seems
to import that he had something to communicate, that was of
far greater moment than the account of his deliverance from
the afflictions he was under in this world. Therefore it seems
more agreeable to understand the sense of the words, as denoting
that great and important truth, in which all believers
are concerned, relating to Christ’s second coming, and the happiness
that his saints shall then enjoy in soul and body; this
deserves to be writ with a pen of iron, that it may be transmitted
to all generations. But,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is evident that he is here speaking of something that
should be done, not whilst he lived, but in the end of time; for
he considers his Redeemer, as <i>standing in the latter day upon
the earth</i>. The person whom he here speaks of as his Redeemer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>is, doubtless, our Saviour, who is frequently described, both
in the Old and New-Testament, under that character: And,
if at any time God the Father is called the Redeemer of his
people, it may farther be observed that he is never said in redeeming
them to make himself visible to their bodily eyes, or
to stand upon the earth, much less to do this in the latter or
last day, in which Christ is said to come again in a visible manner,
to raise the dead and judge the world: And this Job intends
when he says, <i>In my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall
see for myself and mine eyes shall behold, and not another</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is evident also that he intends hereby something that
should befal him after his death, and not barely a deliverance
from his present misery in this world; for he speaks of his
<i>skin</i> or body as devoured by <i>worms</i>, and <i>his reins consumed
within him</i>; which can intend no other than a state of corruption
in death.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. It does not appear that Job had any intimation concerning
the change of his condition in this world, before God turned
his captivity, having first made him sensible of his error, in
<i>uttering that which he understood not</i>, when he testified his reconciliation
to his friends, notwithstanding the injuries he had
received from them, by <i>praying for them</i>, chap. xlii. 3, 10.
And, indeed, he was so far from expecting happiness in this
life, that he says, <i>Mine eye shall no more see good</i>, viz. in this
world, chap. vii. 7. and hereupon he takes occasion to meditate
on his own mortality in the following words; <i>The eye of
him that hath seen me shall see me no more; thine eyes are upon
me, and I am not</i>: And after this he prays, <i>O that thou
wouldst hide me in the grave</i>, chap. xiv. 13. &amp;c. And immediately
before he speaks of his Redeemer as living, and the deliverance
which he should obtain in the latter day, in the text
under our present consideration, he earnestly desires the compassion
of his friends: <i>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me,
O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me</i>; which
does not well agree with the least expectation of a state of happiness
in this world; in which case he would not need their
pity; he might only have convinced them of the truth thereof,
and it would have given a turn to their behaviour towards him;
for we find, that, when God blessed his latter end more than
his beginning, every one was as ready to comfort him concerning
the evil that the Lord had brought upon him, and shew
their very great respect to him, by offering him presents, as
any were before to reproach him. Therefore upon the whole,
it is very evident that Job is not speaking concerning his deliverance
from his present evils in this world, but of a perfect
deliverance from all evil in the great day of the resurrection:
Accordingly we must conclude, that the doctrine of the resurrection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>is plainly asserted in this scripture; and indeed, Jerome
says, that no one who wrote after Christ has more plainly maintained
the doctrine of the resurrection than Job does in this
scripture, who lived before him<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another scripture, by which, if I do not mistake the
sense thereof, Job appears to have had a steady faith in the
doctrine of the resurrection, and was firmly persuaded concerning
his happiness, when raised from the dead, namely, in chap.
xiv. 13, 14, 15. in which he says, <i>O! that thou wouldst hide me
in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret until thy wrath be
past</i>; that is, till a full end is put to all the afflictive providences
which men are liable to in this present world, namely, till the
day of Christ’s second coming; or, <i>that thou wouldst appoint
me a set time, and remember me</i>; namely, that thou wouldst deliver
me from the evils which I now endure. As to the former
of these expedients, to wit, his deliverance by death, that he
counts a blessing, because he takes it for granted that <i>if a man
die he shall live again</i>, ver. 14.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a> and therefore says, <i>all the days
of my appointed time</i>, that is, not of the appointed time of life,
but the time appointed that he should lie in the grave, in which
he desired that God would hide him; there, says he, I shall
wait, or remain, <i>till my change come</i>, that is, till I am changed
from a state of mortality to that of life. And he goes on in the
following words, <i>Thou shalt call</i>, that is, by thy power thou
shalt raise me, <i>and I will answer thee</i>, or come forth out of my
grave; and hereby thou wilt make it known that thou <i>hast a
desire to the work of thine hands</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be objected to this sense of the words, that Job says,
ver. 12. that <i>man lieth down, and riseth not till the heavens be
no more; they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep</i>;
therefore he is so far from expecting relief from his misery in
the resurrection, that he seems plainly to deny it. To this I
answer, that he doth not deny the doctrine of the resurrection
in those words wherein he says that they <i>shall not be raised
from the dead, till the heavens be no more</i>; which seems to intimate
that he concluded that the dead should rise when the
frame of nature was changed, as it will be, at the last day, in
which the heavens shall be no more. I confess this sense is not
commonly given of these verses, nor any argument drawn from,
them to prove a resurrection from the dead; therefore I would
not be too tenacious of mine own sense thereof; but I cannot
but think it more probable than the common sense that is given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of the words, and if so, it may be considered as a proof of the
doctrine that we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another scripture which plainly proves the doctrine
of the resurrection, namely, Dan. xii. 2. <i>Many of them that
sleep in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some
to shame and everlasting contempt.</i> This scripture is brought
by several Rabbinical writers, as a proof of this doctrine; and
the words are so express, that it will be very difficult to evade
the force of them; though, it is true, some modern writers, who
are ready to conclude that the Old Testament is silent as to
the doctrine of the resurrection, take the words in a metaphorical
sense, for the deliverance of the church from those grievous
persecutions which they were under in the reign of Antiochus;
and so <i>sleeping in the dust</i> is taken, by them, for lying
in the holes and caves of the earth, the Jews being forced to
seek protection there from the fury of the tyrant: But this cannot
be properly called <i>sleeping in the dust of the earth</i>; and
their deliverance from this persecution is not consistent with
the contempt that should be cast on some that were raised out
of the dust; nor could the happiness that others enjoyed in this
deliverance, be called <i>everlasting life</i>, it being only a temporal
salvation, that according to them, is here spoken of; and it
must be a straining the metaphor to a great degree, to apply
the following words to their wise men and teachers, after this
deliverance, that they should <i>shine as the brightness of the firmament</i>;
therefore this sense has such difficulties attending it,
that every person who is not prepossessed with prejudice must
give into the literal sense of the text; and confess that it is an
argument to prove the doctrine of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only difficulty that is pretended to be involved in this
sense of the text is its being said, <i>Many of them that sleep in
the dust shall awake</i>; whereas the doctrine that we are defending,
is that of an universal resurrection. But since we shall
have occasion to speak to that under a following head, we shall
rather choose to refer it to its proper place, in which, according
to our designed method, we are to consider that all who have
lived from the beginning to the end of time, shall be raised.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other scriptures in the Old Testament that might
be brought to prove this doctrine, such as that in Deut. xxxii.
39. in which God says, <i>I kill, and I make alive</i>; and that parallel
text, in which the same thing is confessed, and farther explained,
by Hannah, in her song, in 1 Sam. ii. 6. <i>The Lord
killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to the grave, and
bringeth up.</i> I know that death and life are sometimes taken
for good and evil; but why should deliverance from the miseries
of this present life be represented by the metaphor of a resurrection,
and this attributed to the almighty power of God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>if the doctrine of the resurrection was reckoned by the church
at that time, no other than a fiction or chimera, as it must be
supposed to be if they had no idea of it, as not having received
it by divine revelation?</p>

<p class='c006'>We might, as a farther proof of this doctrine, consider those
three instances that we have in the Old Testament of persons
raised from the dead, namely, the Shunamite’s child, by the
prophet Elisha, 2 Kings iv. 35. and the man who was cast into
his sepulchre, that <i>revived and stood on his feet</i>, when he
touched his <i>bones</i>, chap. xiii. 21. and the widow of Zarephath’s
son, by the prophet Elijah, on which occasion it is said, <i>He
cried to the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee let this
child’s soul come into him again</i>; and accordingly the soul of
the child came into him again, and he revived, 1 Kings xvii.
21, 22. From hence we must conclude, that this doctrine was
not unknown to the prophet; for if it had, he could not have
directed his prayer to God in faith. And these instances of a
resurrection of particular persons could not but give occasion
to the church at that time, to believe the possibility of a resurrection
at the last day; so that it might as reasonably be expected
that God will exert his power by raising the dead then,
as that he would do it at this time, unless there was something
in this possible event contrary to his moral perfections; but the
resurrection appeared to them as it doth to all who consider
him as the governor of the world, and as distributing rewards
and punishments to every one according to their works, as not
only agreeable to these perfections, but, in some respects, necessary
for the illustration thereof. Therefore we must conclude,
that as they had particular instances of a resurrection,
which argued the general resurrection possible, they might easily
believe that it should be future; which is the doctrine that
we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this we may add, that the patriarch Abraham believed
the doctrine of the resurrection; therefore he had it some way
or other revealed to him, before the word of God was committed
to writing. This appears from what the apostle says when
speaking concerning his offering Isaac, that <i>he accounted that
God was able to raise him up even from the dead</i>, Heb. xi. 19.
From hence it is evident that he was verily persuaded when he
bound him to the altar, and lifted up his hand to slay him, that
God would suffer him to do it, otherwise it had been no trial
of his faith, so that his being prevented from laying his hand
on him was an unexpected providence. Now how could he
solve the difficulty that would necessarily ensue hereupon; had
he expected that God would give him another seed instead of
Isaac, that would not have been an accomplishment of the promise
which was given to him, namely, that in Isaac his seed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>should be called; therefore the only thing that he depended on,
was, that when he had offered him, God would raise him from
the dead, and by this means fulfil the promise that was made
to him concerning the numerous seed that should descend from
him; therefore it cannot be supposed that Abraham was a
stranger to the doctrine of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other scriptures by which it appears that the doctrine
of the resurrection was revealed to the church under the
Old Testament dispensation, either from the sense of the words
themselves, or the explication thereof in the New, which refers
to them: thus it is said in Psal. xvi. 10. <i>Thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to
see corruption</i>; which the apostle Peter quotes to prove the
resurrection of Christ, in Acts ii. 24-27. If David therefore
knew that the Messiah should be raised from the dead (which,
as will be considered under a following head, is a glorious proof
of the doctrine of the resurrection of the saints) we cannot suppose
that he was a stranger to this doctrine himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is said in Isa. xxv. 8. <i>He will swallow up death in
victory</i>; and this is mentioned immediately after a prediction
of the glorious provision, which God would make for his people
under the gospel-dispensation, which is called, by a metaphorical
way of speaking, ver. 6. <i>A feast of fat things, a feast
of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the
lees well refined</i>; and of the gospel’s being preached to the Gentiles,
ver. 7. which is expressed by his <i>destroying the face of
covering, and the veil that was spread over all nations</i>: therefore
it may well be supposed to contain a prediction of something
consequent thereupon, namely, the general resurrection:
and there is another scripture to the same purpose, viz. Hos.
xiii. 14. <i>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will
redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plague; O grave,
I will be thy destruction</i>; and both these scriptures are referred
to by the apostle, as what shall be fulfilled in the resurrection
of the dead; when he says, <i>Then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory:
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</i>
1 Cor. xv. 54, 55. Therefore we cannot but think that
the prophets, and the church in their day, understood the words
in the same sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another scripture in the Old Testament, in which
the premises are laid down, from whence the conclusion is
drawn in the New for the proof of this doctrine, namely, when
God revealed himself to Moses, Exod. iii. 6. which our Saviour
refers to, and proves the doctrine of the resurrection
from, against the Sadducees. <i>Now that the dead are raised, even
Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: for he
is not the God of the dead, but of the living</i>, Luke xx. 37, 38.
which argument was so convincing, that <i>certain of the Scribes</i>,
said, in the following words, <i>Master, thou hast well said; and
after that, they</i>, that is, the Sadducees, <i>durst not ask him any
question at all</i>; so that it silenced, if it did not convince them.
There are some, indeed, who, though they conclude that it is
a very strong proof of the immortality of the soul, which the
Sadducees denied, since that which does not exist cannot be
the subject of a promise; yet, they cannot see how the resurrection
can be proved from it; whereas it is brought, by our
Saviour, for that purpose: therefore, that the force of this argument
may appear, we must consider what is the import of
the promise contained in this covenant, that God would be the
<i>God of Abraham</i>; which is explained elsewhere, when he told
him, <i>I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward</i>, Gen. xv.
1. He was therefore given hereby to expect, at the hand of
God, all the spiritual and saving blessings of the covenant of
grace; but these blessings respect not only the soul, but the
body; and as they are extended to both worlds, it is an evident
proof of the happiness of the saints in their bodies in a
future state, and consequently that they shall be raised from
the dead. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. To consider those arguments to prove the doctrine of the
resurrection which are contained in the New Testament, in
which it is more fully and expressly revealed than in any part
of scripture. Here we may first take notice of those particular
instances in which our Saviour raised persons from the dead in
a miraculous way, as the prophets Elijah and Elisha did under
the Old Testament dispensation, as was before observed. Thus
he raised Jairus’s <i>daughter</i>, whom he found dead in the house,
Matt. ix. 25. and another, to wit, the <i>widow’s son at Nain</i>, when
they were carrying him to the grave; which was done in the
presence of a great multitude, Luke vii. 11, 14, 15. and there
was another instance hereof in his raising Lazarus from the
dead, John xi. 43, 44. which he did in a very solemn and public
manner, after he had been dead four days, his body being
then corrupted and laid in the grave, from whence Christ calls
him, and he immediately revived and came forth. These instances
of the resurrection of particular persons tended to put
the doctrine of the general resurrection out of all manner of
doubt; and, indeed, it was, at this time, hardly questioned by
any, excepting the Sadducees: therefore before Christ raised
Lazarus, when he only told his sister Martha that he <i>should
rise again</i>, she, not then understanding that he designed immediately
to raise him from the dead, expresses her faith in
the doctrine of the general resurrection; <i>I know that he shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>rise again in the resurrection at the last day</i>, John xi. 24. upon
which occasion our Saviour replies, <i>I am the resurrection and
the life</i>, ver. 25. denoting that this work was to be performed
by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this doctrine was asserted and maintained by the
apostles, after Christ had given the greatest proof hereof in
his own resurrection from the dead: thus it is said, that <i>they
preached through Jesus, the resurrection from the dead</i>, Acts
iv. 2. And the apostle Paul standing before Felix, and confessing
his belief of all things which are written in the law and
the prophets, immediately adds, that he had <i>hope towards God,
which they themselves also allow</i>; that is, the main body of the
Jewish nation; <i>that there shall be a resurrection of the dead,
both of the just and of the unjust</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>And he not only asserts but proves it with very great strength
of reasoning, in 1 Cor. xv. and the argument he therein insists
on, is taken from Christ’s resurrection, ver. 13. <i>If there be no
resurrection, then is Christ not risen</i>; which is a doctrine that
could not be denied by any that embraced the Christian religion,
as being the very foundation thereof; but if any one
should entertain the least doubt about it, he adds, ver. 17. <i>If
Christ be not raised from the dead, your faith is vain, ye are yet
in your sins</i>; that is, your hope of justification hereby is ungrounded,
<i>and they also which are fallen asleep in Christ, are
perished</i>; but this none of you will affirm; therefore you must
conclude that he is risen from the dead: and if it be enquired,
how does this argument prove the general resurrection, that he
farther insists on from ver. 20. <i>Now is Christ risen from the
dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept?</i> Christ’s
resurrection removes all the difficulties that might afford the
least matter of doubt concerning the possibility of the resurrection
of the dead; and his being raised as the <i>first-fruits of
them that slept</i>, or, as the head of all the elect, who are said to
have communion with him in his resurrection, or to be <i>risen
with him</i>, Col. iii. 1. renders the doctrine of the resurrection
of all his saints, undeniably certain. As the first-fruits are a part
and pledge of the harvest, so Christ’s resurrection is a pledge
and earnest of the resurrection of his people. Thus the apostle
says elsewhere, <i>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead
shall also quicken your mortal bodies</i>, Rom. viii. 11. And our
Saviour, when he was discoursing with his disciples concerning
his death, and resurrection that would ensue thereupon,
tells them, that though after this he should be separated for a
time from them, and <i>the world</i> should <i>see him no more</i>, yet
that <i>they should see him</i> again; and assigns this as a reason,
<i>because I live ye shall live also</i>, John xiv. 19. <i>q. d.</i> because I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>shall be raised from the dead, and live for ever in heaven;
you, who are my favourites, friends, and followers, shall be also
raised and live with me there; so that the resurrection of believers
is plainly evinced from Christ’s resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might produce many other scriptures out of the New Testament,
in which this doctrine is maintained; but we shall proceed
to consider what proofs may be deduced from scripture-consequences.
And it may here be observed, that our Lord
Jesus Christ, has by his death and resurrection, as the consequence
thereof, purchased an universal dominion over, or a
right to dispose of his subjects in such a way as will be most
conducive to his own glory and their advantage. Thus the
apostle speaks of him as <i>dying, rising, and reviving, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living</i>; and infers from
thence, that <i>whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s</i>, Rom.
xiv. 8, 9. And his being Lord over the dead is expressed in
other terms, by his <i>having the keys of hell and death</i>; and this
is assigned as the consequence of his <i>being alive</i> after his death,
or of his resurrection from the dead, Rev. i. 18. Therefore he
has a power, as Mediator, to raise the dead. And to this we
may also add, that this is what he has engaged to do, as much
as he did to redeem the souls of his people. When believers
are said to be given to him, or purchased by him, it is the whole
man that is included therein; and accordingly he purchased the
bodies as well as the souls of his people, as may be argued from
our obligation hereupon, to <i>glorify him in our bodies</i> as well as
<i>in our spirits which are God’s</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 20. And they are both
under his care; he has undertaken that their bodies shall not
be lost in the grave; which is very emphatically expressed,
when he is represented as saying, this is <i>the will of the Father
which hath sent me</i>, John vi. 39, 40. or, contained in the commission
that I received from him, when he invested me with
the office of Mediator; <i>that of all which he had given me, I
should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day</i>.
What should be the reason that he here speaks of things rather
than persons, if he had not a peculiar regard to the bodies of
believers? which, as they are the subjects of his power when
raised from the dead; so they are the objects of his care, and
therefore he will raise them up at the last day.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might farther consider Christ’s dominion as extended to
the wicked as well as the righteous. He is not, indeed, their
federal head; but he is appointed to be their Judge; and therefore
has a right to demand them to come forth out of their
graves, to appear before his tribunal; though they are neither
the objects of his special love, nor redeemed by his blood, nor
the dutiful and obedient subjects of his kingdom; inasmuch as
it is said, <i>God has appointed a day in which he will judge the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained,
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
raised him from the dead</i>, Acts xvii. 31. And elsewhere it is
said, that he was ordained <i>of God to be the Judge of quick and
dead</i>, chap. x. 42. Therefore we read, that he shall <i>sit upon the
throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations</i>,
Matt. xxv. 31, 32. and of his determining the final estate, both
of the righteous and the wicked, as it is expressed in the following
verses; and this is described more particularly as being
immediately after the universal resurrection; as it is said, ‘I
saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the
books were opened,’ Rev. xx. 12, 13. which, as will be observed
under our next answer, respects his judging the world;
and in order hereto it is farther said, that ‘the sea gave up the
dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the
dead which were in them; and they were judged every man
according to their works.’ And since Christ is represented as
a judge, it is necessary that he should execute his vindictive
justice against his enemies, and punish them as their sins deserve;
but this respects not only the soul but the body; and
therefore Christ that he may secure the glory of his justice,
shall raise the bodies of sinners, that he may punish them according
to their works; and therefore he is said to be the object
of fear, in that he is <i>able to destroy both soul and body in hell</i>,
Matt. x. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have endeavoured to prove the doctrine of the resurrection
by arguments taken from the Old and New Testament,
and those scripture-consequences from which it may be
plainly deduced: so that how much soever it may be thought a
strange and incredible doctrine, by those who have no other
light to guide them but that of nature; it will be generally believed
by all whose faith is founded upon divine revelation, and
who adore the infinite power and impartial justice of God, the
Governor of the world: and, indeed, it is not attended with
such difficulties arising from the nature of the thing, as many
pretend, since we have several emblems in nature which seem
to illustrate it; which are very elegantly represented by some
of the Fathers, and especially by Tertullian;<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a> whom the learned
and excellent bishop Pearson refers to and imitates in his
style and mode of expression;<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a> his words are these; “As the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>day dies into night, so doth the summer into winter: the sap
is said to descend into the root, and there it lies buried in
the ground. The earth is covered with snow, or crusted with
frost, and becomes a general sepulchre. When the spring appeareth
all begin to rise; the plants and flowers peep out of
their graves, revive, and grow, and flourish; this is the annual
resurrection. The corn by which we live, and for want
of which we perish with famine, is notwithstanding cast upon
the earth, and buried in the ground, with a design that it may
corrupt, and being corrupted, may revive and multiply; our
bodies are fed with this constant experiment, and we continue
this present life by succession of resurrections. Thus all
things are repaired by corrupting, are preserved by perishing,
and revive by dying; and can we think that man, the
lord of all those things, which thus die and revive for him,
should be detained in death, as never to live again? Is it
imaginable that God should thus restore all things to man,
and not restore man to himself? If there were no other consideration
but of the principles of human nature, of the liberty,
and remunerability of human actions, and of the natural
revolutions and resurrections of other creatures, it were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>abundantly sufficient to render the resurrection of our bodies
highly probable.” We shall now consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. Some objections that are generally brought against the
doctrine of the resurrection. Some things, indeed, are objected
against it, that are so vain and trifling, that they do not deserve
an answer: as when the followers of Aristotle assert
that it is impossible for a thing which is totally destroyed, to
be restored to that condition in which it was before<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a>: And
some have been so foolish as to think that those nations, who
burnt their dead bodies, put an eternal bar in the way of their
resurrection; since the particles being so changed and separated
by fire as they are, can never return again to their former
bodies; or they who have been swallowed up by the ocean, and
the particles of which they consisted, dissolved by water; and
every one of them separated from the other, can never be again
restored to their former situation. Such-like objections as these,
I say, do not deserve an answer; because they consider the resurrection
as though it were to be brought about in such a way,
as effects are produced by second causes, according to the common
course of nature; without any regard to the almighty power
of God, that can easily surmount all the difficulties which,
they pretend, lie in the way of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there are other objections, taken from a perverse sense,
which they give of some texts of scripture, without considering
the drift and design thereof, or what is added in some following
words, which sufficiently overthrows the objection. Thus
some produce that scripture in Eccles. iii. 19, 20, 21. where
it is said, <i>That which befalleth the sons of men, befalleth beasts.
So that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast, all go unto
one place, and all are of the dust, and all turn to the dust again</i>;
which we before mentioned as brought against the immortality
of the soul; and it is also alleged against the resurrection of
the body, by those who conclude that it shall be no more raised
from the dead than the bodies of brute creatures. But this
is rather a cavil or a sophism, than a just way of reasoning;
inasmuch as the following words plainly intimate, that men and
beasts are compared together only as to their mortality, not as
to what respects their condition after death; and therefore it is
no sufficient argument to overthrow the doctrine of the resurrection.
These and such-like objections are so trifling, that
we shall not insist on them: However, there are three or four
that we shall lay down, and consider what answers may be
given to them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. It is objected against the doctrine of the resurrection,
that though the power of God can do all things possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>to be done; yet the raising the dead, at least, in some particular
instances thereof, is impossible from the nature of the
thing; and therefore we may say, without any reflection cast
on the divine Omnipotency, that God cannot raise them, at
least, not so as that every one shall have his own body restored
to him; since there are some instances of Cannibals, or men-eaters,
who devour one another, by which means the flesh of
one man is turned into the flesh of the other. And in those
instances which are more common, the bodies of men being
turned into dust, produce food, like other parts of the earth,
for brute creatures; and accordingly some of those particles
of which they consisted, are changed into the flesh of these
creatures; and these again are eaten by men; so that the particles
of one human body, after having undergone several changes,
become a part of another; therefore there cannot be a distinct
resurrection of every one of those bodies that have lived
in all the ages of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that it cannot be proved,
that in those instances mentioned in the objection, that when
one man preys upon another, or when brute creatures live upon
that grass which was produced by the ground, which was
made fertile by the bodies of men turned to corruption, and it
may be, may have some of the particles thereof contained in
them: It cannot, I say, be proved, that these particles of the
bodies of men are turned into nourishment, and so become a
part of human flesh; since providence did not design this to be
for food. If so, then it is not true in fact, that the particles of
one human body become a part of another. But, suppose it
were otherwise (to give the objection as much weight as possible)
we may farther observe, that it is but a very small part
of what is eaten, that is turned into flesh; and therefore those
particles of one human body, that by this means are supposed
to pass into another, make up but a very inconsiderable part
thereof. Therefore, if some few particles of one human body
in the resurrection are restored again to that body to which
they at first belonged, this will not overthrow the doctrine of
the resurrection of the same body. If the body of man loses
a few ounces of its weight, no one will suppose that it is not
the same body. So when the bodies of men are raised from
the dead, if the far greater part of the particles thereof are recollected
and united together, they may truly be said to constitute
the same body; this therefore does not overthrow the
resurrection of the same body from the nature of the thing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 2. It is farther objected, especially against the possibility
of the resurrection of the same body that was once alive
in this world; that the bodies of men, while they live, are subject
to such alterations, that it can hardly be said that we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the same when we are men as when we are children. The expence
of those particles which were insensibly lost by perspiration,
and others being daily gained by nutrition, make such
an alteration in the contexture of the body, that, as some suppose,
in the space of about seven years, almost all the particles
of the body are changed, some lost and others regained. Now
if it be supposed that the same body we once had shall be raised,
it is hard to determine; whether those particles of which
it consisted when we were young, shall be gathered together
in the resurrection, or the particles of the emaciated or enfeebled
body, which was laid down in the grave.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> We are obliged to take notice of such-like objections
as these, because they are often alleged in a cavilling way, against
the doctrine of the resurrection. The answer therefore
that I would give to this, is, that the more solid and substantial
parts of the body, such as the skin, bones, cartilages, veins,
arteries, nerves, fibres, that compose the muscles, with the ligaments
and tendons, are not subject to this change that is
mentioned in the objection, by evaporation or perspiration;
which more especially respects the fluids, and not the solids of
the body. These remain the same in men as they were in
children, excepting what respects their strength and size: And
if the body, as consisting of these and some other of the particles
that it has lost, which the wisdom of God thinks fit to recollect,
be gathered together in the resurrection; we may truly
say, that the same body that once lived, notwithstanding the
change made in the fluids thereof, is raised from the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 3. There is another objection which is sometimes
brought against the doctrine of the resurrection of the just, especially
against their being raised with the same body they once
had, taken from the inconsistency hereof, with their living in
the other world, called heaven; which is generally distinguished
from the earth, as being a more pure subtil and etherial region,
therefore not fit to be an habitation for bodies compounded
of such gross matter as ours are, which are adapted to the
state and world in which they now live: Whereas, to suppose
them placed in heaven, is inconsistent with the nature of gravity;
so that we may as well conclude a body, which naturally
tends to the earth its centre, to be capable of living in the air,
at a distance from the surface of the earth, as we can, that it is
possible for such a body to live in heaven: Therefore they argue
that the bodies of men, at the resurrection must be changed,
so as to become etherial, which does, in effect, overthrow
the doctrine of the resurrection, as respecting, at least, the restoring
the bodies of men to the same form which once they
had.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this objection is farther improved by another supposition:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>which gave the Socinians occasion to assert, that the
same body shall not be raised; namely, that if the bodies of
men should be the same as they are now, they would be rendered
incapable of that state of immortality which is in heaven.
For by the same method of reasoning, by which, as has
been before observed, they argue that man would have been
liable to mortality, though he had not sinned, <i>viz.</i> that death
was then the consequence of nature, inasmuch as the body was
to be supported by food, breathe in proper air, and be fenced
against those things that might tend to destroy the temperament
thereof, or a dissolution would ensue, they conclude that we
must not have such bodies as we now have, but etherial. And
to give countenance to this, they refer to the apostle’s words
in 1 Cor. xv. 50. <i>Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God</i>: And ver. 40. where he speaks of <i>celestial bodies</i> as distinguished
from <i>terrestrial</i>, and of the body’s being raised a
<i>spiritual body</i>, ver. 44. And there is another scripture generally
referred to, wherein our Saviour speaks of believers, in
the resurrection, being <i>as the angels of God</i>, Matt. xxii. 30.
which is to be understood, at least, as signifying that their motion
will be no more hindered by the weight of the body, than
the motion of an angel is; therefore their bodies must be of
another kind than what we suppose they shall be in the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> 1. As to what respects the inconsistency of bodies
like ours, living in the upper world, as being contrary to the
nature of gravitation: It may be answered, that according to the
generally received opinion of modern philosophers, gravity arises
from an external pressure made upon bodies which are
said to be heavy or light, according to the force thereof; and
therefore those bodies that are in the upper regions, above the
atmosphere, are equally adapted to ascend or descend; which
sufficiently answers that part of the objection. This a learned
writer takes notice of<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a>: And if this be not acquiesced in, he
advances another hypothesis; which, because it has something
of wit and spirit in it, I shall take leave to mention, though I
must suspend my judgment concerning it, whether it be true
or false. He says, perhaps, our heaven will be nothing else but
an heaven upon earth; and that it seems more natural to suppose
that, since we have solid and material bodies, we shall
be placed as we are in this life, in some solid and material orb;
and this he supposes agreeable to the apostle Peter’s words,
when he speaks of a <i>new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness</i>,
2 Pet. iii. 13. From whence he concludes, that either this
world shall be fitted to be the seat of the blessed, or some
other that has a solid basis like unto it. And to give countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>to this opinion, he refers to some ancient writers; and
particularly tells us, that Maximus speaks of it as the opinion
of many in his time; and Epiphanius brings in Methodius in
the third century, as asserting the same thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As to what concerns that part of the objection, that bodies,
like those we have now, are unmeet for the heavenly state, inasmuch
as they cannot be supported without food and other
conveniences of nature, which tend to the preservation of life
in this world. To this it may be answered, that it is not necessary
to suppose that the body shall be raised with such qualities
as that it will stand in need of food, rest, or other conveniences
of nature; which, at present, tend to the support of life:
The apostle seems to assert the contrary, when he says, <i>Meats
for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both
it and them</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 13. There is certainly a medium between
asserting, with some, that we shall be raised with an
etherial body, in all respects unlike to that which we have at
present; and maintaining, that we shall have such as are liable
to the imperfections of this present state, and supported in the
same way in which they now are.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what the apostle says concerning <i>flesh and blood not
inheriting the kingdom of heaven</i>, he does not mean thereby that
our bodies shall be so changed, that they shall in no respect
consist of flesh and blood: And when he speaks of <i>celestial</i>
and <i>spiritual</i> bodies, it is not necessary for us to suppose, that
hereby he intends ærial or etherial bodies. But this will be
more particularly considered under a following head, when we
speak of the circumstances in which the bodies of believers
shall be raised from the dead. As for that other scripture, in
which they are said to be <i>as the angels of God in heaven</i>, that
respects their being immortal and incorruptible; or as the context
seems to intimate, that they need not marriage, to perpetuate
their generations, in that world: Therefore we have no
occasion to strain the sense of the words, so as to suppose that
our Saviour intends in his saying <i>they shall be as the angels</i>,
that they shall cease to be like what they were when men on
earth.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> 4. The last objection which we shall mention, is taken
from its not being agreeable to the goodness of God, extended
to those who are made partakers of the resurrection to eternal
life; inasmuch as it is a bringing them into a worse condition
than the soul was in, when separate from the body. This objection
is generally brought by those who give into that mode
of speaking often used by Plato<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a> and his followers, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>body in this world, is the prison of the soul, which at death, is
set at liberty: therefore they suppose, that its being united to
the body again, is no other than its being condemned to a second
imprisonment, which is so far from being a favour conferred,
that it rather seems to be a punishment inflicted. Others, with
Celsus, reckon it a dishonour for the soul to be reunited to a
body that is corrupted.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a> And others speak of the body as being
a great hindrance to the soul in its actings; and frequently
inclining it to the exercise of some of those passions that tend
to make men uneasy, and thereby unhappy; and that this may,
some way or other, take place in a future state.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> It is no great difficulty to answer this objection, in
which there is not a due difference put between the present and
future state of believers. The only thing which might give occasion
to men to conclude that their souls are imprisoned in
this world is, because they are abridged of that happiness which
they shall be possessed of in another; which the apostle calls
<i>The glorious liberty of the children of God</i>, Rom. viii. 21. And
as for the reproaches which some of the greatest enemies to
Christianity have cast on this doctrine, these are not sufficient
to beget the least dislike of it in the minds of serious and unprejudiced
Christians. What though the body be turned to corruption?
It shall be raised incorruptible, and in glory; and
therefore shall be a palace fit to entertain its noble inhabitant:
what though it has, in this world, offered many temptations to
the soul to sin, by which it has been sometimes overcome and
exposed to those passions that have defiled, and made it very
uneasy; is this to be objected against its being raised from the
dead in such a state of perfection, that it shall never more contract
any guilt, or render the soul unhappy, by any inconvenience
arising from it? But this will farther appear, when we
speak of the condition in which the body shall be raised under
a following head. We shall therefore proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. To consider the resurrection of the dead as universal,
including in it all who have lived, or shall live, from the beginning
of time, till Christ’s second coming, excepting those
who shall be found alive; on whom a change shall pass which
is equivalent to a resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That all the dead shall be raised: this is expressly mentioned
in that vision, <i>I saw the dead both small and great, standing
before God; and the books were opened; and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in the books, according
to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which
were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>in them; and they were judged every man according to their
works</i>, Rev. xx. 12, <i>&amp; seq.</i> where the Judge is represented as
demanding the bodies of men of all ranks, conditions, and ages,
out of those places where they have been lodged, with a design
to reward or punish them according to their works: therefore,
if the justice of God is to be displayed in this solemn and awful
transaction, and the bodies as well as the souls of men, are the
subjects on which this judgment must pass; then it follows,
that it will be universal: thus our Saviour says, <i>All that are in
the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth; they that
have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have
done evil unto the resurrection of damnation</i>, John v. 28, 29.
This is so evident a truth, founded on the divine perfections,
as well as express words of scripture, that it is strange to find
that any, who allow that the dead shall be raised, should deny
the universality thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, we meet with several expressions in Rabbinical
writers, which seem to speak of it as a peculiar privilege belonging
to some, but not to all; and therefore they have a proverbial
expression, that though the rain descends on the just
and on the unjust, yet the resurrection of the dead belongs only
to the just:<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> and this they infer from the words of the prophet
Daniel, in chap. xii. 2. <i>Many of them that sleep in the dust of
the earth shall awake</i>; which words contain a difficulty which
most have found it an hard matter to account for, agreeably to
the sense of the prophet, who speaks, in the words immediately
following, of the consequence hereof, as, <i>some</i> shall awake <i>to
everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt</i>;
whereby he divides the world into two parts, and considers one
as happy, the other as miserable; therefore he must, doubtless,
speak of an universal resurrection. But the great difficulty lies
in these words; <i>Many of them that sleep in the dust shall arise</i>;
from whence, some conclude that this expression contains an
exception of others who shall not arise: thus some Jewish
writers seem to have understood it; but I rather think, that
the word <i>many</i>, there, imports nothing else but the <i>multitude</i>,
<i>q. d.</i> the whole number of those that sleep shall awake.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>It is somewhat hard to determine what the Rabbinical writers
intend when they seem to confine the resurrection to the
Israelites; and some of them to exclude, not only the wicked
from it, but those that had not addicted themselves to the study
of the law, whom they call the Gnam Haaretz: thus they are
represented in scripture as giving them but a very indifferent
character, <i>The people that knoweth not the law are accursed</i>,
John vii. 49. by this means they bring the number of those that
shall be raised from the dead into a very narrow compass: nevertheless
they speak of future rewards and punishments in
another world; therefore some have thought, when they exclude
all but the Israelites, and, of them, all but those who
were in the greatest reputation amongst them, that they understand
nothing else by the resurrection, but that which they fancied
would happen in the days of the Messiah; in which, they
suppose, that some of the Jews shall be raised from the dead
before the general resurrection at the last day; and in this sense
we may easily understand their exclusive account, when they
speak of many that shall not be partakers of this privilege; and
if it be extended to the resurrection at the last day, then I am
apt to think, that they intend hereby a resurrection to eternal
life, and so some understand that common proverb but now
mentioned, concerning the rain’s descending upon all; but the
resurrection’s belonging only to the just, in this sense; that
though the rain descends upon the wilderness, and barren
ground; yet it is only some places which are made fruitful
thereby: accordingly, though the resurrection be universal,
both of the righteous and wicked; yet the resurrection to eternal
life belongs only to the just.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>All that I shall observe at present is, that this is not altogether
disagreeable to the scripture-mode of speaking; which,
though in some places it asserts the resurrection of the whole
world, in others, by the resurrection, we are to understand nothing
else, but a resurrection to eternal life: thus the apostle
Paul, when he speaks of his <i>attaining unto the resurrection of
the dead</i>, Phil. iii. 11. intends hereby his obtaining a glorious
resurrection. And our Saviour, when speaking concerning the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>happiness of the saints in another world, expresses it on this
wise; that they shall be <i>counted worthy</i>, or meet, <i>to obtain that
world, and the resurrection from the dead</i>, Luke xx. 35. so that
whatever is said by Jewish writers, tending to limit the resurrection
of the dead to eternal life, to some particular persons,
it does not appear but that even they held, in other respects,
a general resurrection, both of the just and unjust; which is as
demonstrable as is the resurrection in general.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They who are found alive at Christ’s second coming,
shall undergo a change; which, though it cannot be called a
resurrection, will be equivalent to it. The apostle Paul gives
an account of this, as what was before unknown to the church;
<i>Behold I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trump</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52. And elsewhere he speaks of
them when thus changed, as <i>caught up in the clouds together
with</i> other saints, that are raised from the dead, <i>to meet the
Lord in the air</i>, 1 Thess. iv. 17. This is no less an effect of
almighty power than a resurrection; for hereby their bodies,
though never separated from their souls, are brought into the
same state as the bodies of others shall be, when re-united to
them, and thereby be rendered incorruptible and immortal, as
the bodies of all other saints shall be, and made partakers of
the same glory with which they are said to be raised. We have
an emblem of this in Christ’s transfiguration, when there was
such a change made, for the present, on his body, that his face
shined as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And
there was not only a resemblance, but a kind of specimen hereof,
in the translation of Enoch and Elijah, whose bodies were
before this, liable to corruption, and all other infirmities that
attend this present life, but were made, in a moment, celestial
and glorious. And the body of our Saviour, though it was
raised from the dead incorruptible and immortal, yet, during
the space of forty days, while he continued on earth, it was not
made so glorious as it was immediately after the cloud received
him into heaven, when it underwent such a change as was
agreeable to the place and state into which he then entered;
even so the bodies of the saints, at last, shall, by this change, be
made meet for heaven, and received, with other saints into it.</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. We shall now consider the condition in which the body
shall be raised. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Those circumstances of honour and glory which respect
more especially the resurrection of the just: this the apostle
mentions, and describes them as <i>raised in glory</i>, 1, Cor. xv.
43. It is the same body indeed, that is raised, which he illustrates
by <i>a grain of wheat</i> springing up, and changed into a
full-grown ear; which, though it be greatly improved, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>much altered from what it was, when cast into the ground, yet
<i>every seed</i>, as he observes, has <i>its own body</i>, ver. 38. From
whence we may infer, that the same body shall be raised from
the dead, though with very different qualities. There are several
things mentioned by the apostle, in the account he gives of
the bodies of the saints after the resurrection; which some have
attempted to explain in such a way, as is hardly consistent with
a resurrection of the same body. The Socinians generally maintain
that the body shall be altogether new, as to its substance,
as well as its qualities: and others speak of it as an aerial body;
as supposing that the gross and heavy matter, of which it formerly
consisted, is not adapted to an heavenly state, and would
render it not altogether free from a liableness to corruption.
This opinion a late writer mentions, as what was espoused by
some of the Fathers, which he speaks very favourably of; and
inasmuch as the apostle calls it <i>a spiritual body</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 45.
and seems to distinguish it from <i>flesh and blood</i>, which <i>cannot
inherit the kingdom of God</i>, ver. 50. he thinks that though the
same flesh and blood may rise from the grave, it will then or
afterwards, receive such a change, as will render it spiritual
and incorruptible; and so, perhaps, when it comes to heaven,
will not be flesh and blood; or, that it will clothed with such
an heavenly body as will keep it from a possibility of corruption;
and accordingly he supposes that the apostle is to be understood
in this sense, that flesh and blood unchanged and unclothed
with its heavenly body, cannot inherit the kingdom of
God; and that this body with which it shall be invested, will
be thin, aerial, spiritual, bright, and shining; and, in that respect,
may be called celestial.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a> The reason he assigns why
<i>flesh and blood</i>, namely, such as is subject to corruption here,
<i>cannot inherit the kingdom of God</i>, is, because the flesh may be
cut and divided, and the blood let out, which would subject it
to corruption; therefore it must be changed, and <i>put on incorruption</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This account of the bodies of the just after the resurrection,
seems, indeed, to be a medium between the two extremes, either
of those who suppose that the body shall differ but little from
what it was whilst here on earth, or of others, who conclude
it to be nothing else but an aerial body; yet it contains several
things taken for granted, without sufficient proof, which I cannot
readily give into: nevertheless what he farther adds on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>subject is undeniably true, <i>viz.</i> that the body, which before
was subject to filth and deformity, is raised in glory and splendor,
<i>shining like the sun</i>, Matt. xxiii. 43. That which was
once <i>vile</i>, is <i>fashioned like Christ’s glorious body</i>, Phil. iii. 21.
and is freed from all defect or deformity in its members, and
from any dishonourable parts. Not subject to weakness by
labour, decays of age, to impotency and wasting by diseases;
but nimble, strong, active, and that without reluctancy or molestation,
grief, pain, or lassitude; it is raised a spiritual body,
possessed and acted by the Holy Spirit; and advanced so far
to the perfection of spirits, as to be free from grossness, ponderosity,
from needing rest, sleep, or sustenance, and is fitted
for a spiritual and celestial state in which our bodies shall
wholly serve our spirits, and depend upon them, and therefore
may be styled spiritual. If we stop here, without giving too
much scope to our wit and fancy, in advancing things too high
for us, and confess that we know not, or, at least, but a little
of the affairs of an unseen world; or, as the apostle says, <i>what
we shall be</i>, Phil. iii. 21. we say enough to give us an occasion
to conclude that it is a glorious and desirable state, and the
change wrought therein, such as fully answers our most raised
expectations, and is agreeable to a state of perfect blessedness.
Thus concerning the condition and circumstances in which the
saints shall be raised.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one thing which must not wholly be past over,
which is farther observed in this answer, namely, that the
bodies of the just shall be raised by the Spirit of Christ: This
is what the apostle expressly says, <i>If the Spirit of him that raised
up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit
that dwelleth in you</i>, Rom. viii. 11. The bodies of believers,
which were, in this world, the temple of the Holy Ghost, and
were under his divine influence whilst living, shall not cease
to be the objects of his care when dead; and as an instance of
his regard to them, as well as denoting the subserviency hereof,
to their attaining that complete redemption which Christ has
purchased for them, the Spirit, in a peculiar manner, demonstrates
his personal glory in raising them from the dead:
Whereas, others are said to be raised only by the power of
Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall now consider the circumstances in which the
wicked shall be raised, namely, in dishonour; or, as the prophet
Daniel expresses it, <i>to shame and everlasting contempt</i>.
Some marks of dishonour shall, doubtless, be impressed on
their bodies, in that they shall be raised with all those natural
blemishes and deformities, which rendered them the object of
contempt. That part which the body bore in tempting the soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>to sin, shall tend to its everlasting reproach; and when reunited
to it, those habits of sin which were contracted, shall incurably
remain, as well as the tormenting sense of guilt consequent
hereupon, which exposes them to the wrath of God for ever;
so that their resurrection, which renders them immortal, brings
upon them endless misery. And it is said to be brought about
by Christ, as an offended Judge, as the consequence whereof,
they are summoned to his tribunal, who will render to every
one according to his works. Which leads us to consider Christ
as coming to judge the world; which is that solemn transaction
that will immediately follow after the resurrection.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-88' class='c003'>Quest. LXXXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXVIII.</span> <i>What shall immediately follow after the
resurrection?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the
general and final judgment of angels and men; the day and
hour whereof no man knoweth, that all may watch and pray,
and be ever ready for the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our Lord Jesus Christ having finished the work which he
undertook to perform, in gathering in his elect, and bringing
that grace which he wrought in them to perfection; the
only thing then remaining to be done, will be his receiving
them into his immediate presence, to behold his glory; and
banishing others, for ever, from him, with marks of infamy and
detestation. And, in order hereunto, he will raise the dead,
and give a summons to the whole world of angels and men,
to appear before his tribunal in that day in which he is appointed,
by the Father, to judge the world in righteousness;
which is the subject insisted on in this answer. In speaking
to which, we shall</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Prove that there shall be a day of judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. Consider the person, the character, and the solemnity of
the appearing of the great Judge, to whom this work is committed.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The persons to be judged, angels and men.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. The manner in which he shall proceed in judging them.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. Some circumstances concerning the place where, and the
time when this great and awful work shall be performed.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We are to prove that there shall be a day of judgment.
This is as evident a truth as that there is a providence, or that
God is the Governor of the world. Every intelligent creature,
who is the subject of moral government, affords an argument
for the proof of this doctrine. And accordingly we must consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>them as under a law which he has given, as that by which
they are to be governed. From hence arises our obligation to
duty, and being rendered accountable to the great Lawgiver,
as to what concerns our obedience to, or violation of his law.
And God is obliged, in honour, to make a scrutiny into, or
take an account of our behaviour, that it may be known whether
we have obeyed or rebelled against him. This is evident
from the concern which the glory of his own perfections has
herein; and the promises and threatnings annexed to his law,
which he is obliged to fulfil or execute. From whence it follows,
that God will display his glory as the Judge of the
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is plainly revealed in scripture; it was foretold in the
early ages of the world, as contained in the epistle of Jude, in
ver. 14, 15. <i>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his
saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have
ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him</i>: which words, though they
might have a peculiar relation to the judgment which God
would execute in the destruction of the old world; yet it is
plain by the application hereof made by the apostle, that it
looks as far as the final judgment, which shall be in the end of
time. And this likewise appears from what is said in Eccles.
xii. 14. that <i>God shall bring every work into judgment, with
every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil</i>.
There are, indeed, many displays of God’s judicial hand in the
present dispensations of his providence, as he is said to be
<i>known by the judgment which he executeth</i>, Psal. ix. 16. The
visible token of his regard to his saints in this world, as well
as the public and dreadful display of his vengeance poured
forth upon his enemies, proclaim his glory, as God, the Judge
of all. But inasmuch as sin deserves greater punishments than
what are inflicted here; and the promises which God has made
for the encouragement of his people, give them occasion to
look beyond the present scene of affairs; and especially since
the divine dealings with men, as to what respects outward
things, cannot so clearly be accounted for, while we behold the
righteous oppressed, and many of the wicked having, as it
were, more than heart could wish; this plainly argues, that
there is a time coming when matters will be adjusted; and, as
the Psalmist says, ‘A man shall say,’ or every one shall have
occasion to say, ‘Verily there is a reward for the righteous;
verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth,’ Psal. lviii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this doctrine is not only revealed in scripture, but
it is impressed on the consciences of men; which, though they
never took so much pains to extinguish their apprehension or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>dread thereof, it is impossible for them to do it. That secret
remorse or terror which sinners feel within their own breasts,
which makes them restless and uneasy, especially when they
perceive themselves to stand on the confines of another world,
is an undeniable argument that there is a future judgment.
What was it that made Belshazzar’s <i>countenance to change</i>?
Why did his <i>thoughts trouble him, so that the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote one against another</i>, when he
saw the <i>hand-writing on the wall</i>, in the midst of all his mirth
and jollity? Dan. v. 6. Was he afraid of the united forces of
the Persians and Medes, who at that time invested the capital
city in which he was? Did he know that he should be slain before
the morning? That was most remote from his thoughts,
as apprehending himself safe from any danger that might arise
from that quarter. Was he afraid of punishment from men?
His condition in the world set him above the dread of any
such event. It was only the sense he had of a future judgment
from God, that produced these effects in him. It was this
that made the Heathen governor <i>tremble</i>, when the apostle <i>reasoned
of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come</i>, Acts
xxiv. 25. And when he was disputing with the Athenians,
though they mocked and treated what he said about the resurrection
with ridicule; yet none of them had any thing to object
against this doctrine that <i>God would judge the world in
righteousness</i>, chap. xvii. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be observed that the doctrine of future rewards and
punishments, as the result of a sentence passed on men after
death, is so often mentioned by heathen-writers, that it is evident
they either received by tradition, or understood it by the
light of nature; though, when they enter into particular explications
thereof, we meet with little but what is fabulous and
trifling. Some of them suppose the rewards and punishments
to be in other bodies, agreeably to the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls, as before-mentioned. Others speak of fictitious
lakes and rivers in the other world, where men are doomed
to abide, at least, for some time; though they know nothing
of the day of judgment, or the appearance of the whole world
before Christ’s tribunal; which is a matter of pure revelation<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>II. We are now to consider the person, character, and solemnity
of the appearing of the great Judge, to whom this
work is more especially committed. This is a doctrine that
can be known no other way than by divine revelation. The
light of nature, indeed, discovers to us that God shall judge
the world; but there is something more than this may be learned
from scripture, as well as those circumstances of glory with
which this work shall be performed. Accordingly we read,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the person who is to perform this great work, is the
Lord Jesus Christ; of whom it is said, he shall <i>judge the quick
and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 1.
And elsewhere, <i>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of
Christ</i>; 2 Cor. v. 10. If we consider his glory as a divine
person, he is fit to engage in it. For as he knoweth all things,
he can judge the secrets of men, which no mere creature can
do; and as he has all the other perfections of the divine nature,
he can display and glorify them, in such a way as is necessary,
in determining the final estate of men, and rewarding every
one according to his work.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may also observe, that this is a branch of his Mediatorial
dignity, and contains in it a part of the execution of his
Kingly office; it was contained in that commission which he
received of the Father. Thus it is said, that <i>the Father judgeth
no man</i>, John v. 22. that is, not in a visible manner, or by
any delegated power, which he is invested with, ‘but hath
committed all judgment to the Son,’ and, it is said, he has
‘given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is
the Son of man,’ ver. 27. And to this we may add, that it is
a part of the work which was incumbent on him in the application
of redemption, which cannot be said to be brought to
the utmost perfection, till the day of judgment: Thus when he
speaks concerning his ‘coming in a cloud with power and great
glory’; then he bids his people ‘lift up their heads, inasmuch
as their redemption draweth nigh,’ Luke xxi. 27, 28. We
might also add to this, that it was very expedient that he should
judge the world, since he was unjustly judged and condemned
by the world; therefore the cause must have a second hearing,
that his enemies, at whose bar he once stood, may be fully
convinced, to their eternal confusion, that he was not the person
they took him to be, that he did not deserve the treatment
and rude insults which he met with from them, when he stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>at their tribunal. They asked him this question, ‘Art thou
the Christ, the Son of the blessed?’ to which he replied, ‘I
am: And ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven,’ Mark
xiv. 61-64. wherein he applied to himself what the prophet
Daniel said concerning him, Dan. vii. 13. and thereby intimated,
that this would be the most visible and incontestible proof
of his Mediatorial glory, with which he was invested, as the
Son of man; upon which the high-priest rent his clothes, apprehending
that he spake blasphemy; after which they all condemned
him to be guilty of death. Therefore it is expedient
that this visible proof of his Sonship and Mediatorial glory
should be given, and that he should perform this great work,
which was incumbent on him, as he gave them to expect. It
is his ‘coming with clouds, that every eye shall see;’ that shall
oblige ‘them which pierced him, and all the kindreds of the
earth,’ who set themselves against him, ‘to wail because of
him,’ Rev. i. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was also necessary that he should judge the world, that he
might publicly vindicate his people, who have been judged and
condemned by the world for his sake; and that his cause and
interest, which has been trampled on by them, might be defended
in the most public and glorious manner, which will afford
an everlasting conviction, that he whom men despised,
whose glory was set light by, whose gospel was rejected and
persecuted, is a person worthy of universal honour and esteem.
Thus concerning the person who is appointed to judge
the world, and the character in which he shall do it: which
leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. To consider the solemnity of his appearing, when engaging
in it. The work being the most glorious that ever was
performed since the world was created, and the honour redounding
to Christ as the result thereof, being the last and
highest degree of his state of exaltation; it cannot but be supposed
that he will appear with those ensigns of majesty and
regal dignity that become his character as the Judge of quick
and dead: accordingly we have an account of his ‘appearing
in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy angels,’
Luke ix. 26. <i>His own glory</i> respects the rays of his divinity
shining forth; whereby it will appear, that he has a natural
right to summon the whole world before him. This cannot but
strike a terror into his enemies, and enhance the joy and triumph
of his friends, and excite the adoration that is due to so
glorious a person. His appearing in <i>his Father’s glory</i>, denotes
that this is the highest display of his Mediatorial dignity; the
reward of his having perfectly fulfilled the commission given
him by the Father, and fully answered the end for which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>became incarnate. And his appearing in the <i>glory of his holy
angels</i>, implies the reverence and homage which they will pay
to him, into whose hands they are given, as ministering spirits,
to fulfil his pleasure, and who always rejoice in the advancement
of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>The angels shall not indeed be employed in raising the dead,
for that is a work too great for finite power; but we read of
their ministry as subservient to the glory of the solemnity, as
consisting in their appearing with Christ as his retinue; so it is
said, that he shall ‘come in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him,’ Matt. xxv. 31. These, indeed make up his train;
but do not convey to him the least branch of that glory or character
he is invested with: but it is their honour to attend him,
whose servants they are; their work is to praise and adore him,
and to shew their readiness to fulfil his pleasure, without desiring
to usurp the least branch of his glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first thing they are represented as doing, is, their attending
his coming with a shout, or the word of command first given
forth by Christ, and transmitted by them to the whole world,
whereby they shall be summoned to appear before him. This
shall doubtless be attended with universal joy and triumph expressed
by them. And whereas Christ is said to <i>come with the
sound of a trumpet</i>, 1 Thess. iv. 16. this is either to be considered
in allusion to the custom of calling the hosts together,
which was by the sound of a trumpet, Num. x. 2. <i>&amp;c.</i><a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a> or
else we may understand it in a literal sense, for some sound
like that of a trumpet, which shall be heard throughout the
world, which shall have a tendency to excite the joy and triumph
of the saints, and to strike terror into the wicked. And
as this trumpet gives an alarm to all to appear before Christ’s
tribunal; the angels are represented as assisting in bringing
them thither. It is by them that the saints <i>which remain alive,
shall be caught up</i> with others <i>in the clouds to meet the Lord in
the air</i>, 1 Thess. iv. 17. and they are said to <i>gather together
the elect from the four winds, from one end of the heaven to the
other</i>.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> And elsewhere, our Saviour, speaking of the <i>end of the
world</i>, which he calls the <i>harvest</i>, represents the angels as
<i>reapers</i>, Matt. xiii. 39. which he explains as denoting that <i>at
the end of the world the angels shall come forth, and sever the
wicked from among the just</i>, ver. 49. which plainly intimates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>that they are to gather the elect together. And inasmuch as
there must be a separation between them and the wicked, so
that one shall be set at Christ’s right hand, the other at his left;
this, as it is more than probable, shall be done by the ministry
of angels, chap. xxv. 32. And then the Judge is represented
as <i>sitting on his throne</i>, ver. 31. this is called elsewhere a judgment-seat,
agreeable to his character as a judge; and it is here
styled his throne, as expressive of the majesty and royal dignity
with which he shall perform this great work. Which
leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. To consider the persons who are to be judged, things
being thus prepared for it; and these are said to be angels and
men, <i>i. e.</i> all who are summoned to appear before Christ’s tribunal.
Whether the holy angels are included in the number of
those whom Christ will judge, it is not safe for us to pretend
to determine, since scripture is silent as to this matter. That
they are the subjects of moral government is evident, because
they are intelligent creatures; and it follows from hence, that
they are accountable to God for their behaviour as such. It is
also certain, that they are employed by our Saviour, in <i>fulfilling
his pleasure</i>; and pursuant thereto, they are <i>sent forth by
him to minister to the heirs of salvation</i>, Heb. i. 14. and upon
this account it may not be reckoned foreign to the work of the
day, for Christ to give a public testimony to their faithfulness
in the discharge of every work which has been committed to
them; especially since the saints, who, in some respects, may
be said to have been their charge and care, have received no
small advantage from the good offices which they have performed
for them by Christ’s appointment: but more than this,
I think, cannot be determined, with respect to their being judged
by Christ. Therefore, many conclude, that, properly speaking,
they are not included in the number of those that shall be
judged by him; and that either because they are represented
as attending him, when he comes to judgment; and are never
spoken of as standing before his tribunal, as persons whose
cause is to be tried by him; or because they are considered, as
long before this confirmed in holiness and happiness, and as
beholding the face of God in heaven; and consequently not to
be dealt with as those who are to undergo a farther scrutiny,
in order to their having, a new sentence passed upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what respects the fallen angels, they are to be brought
as criminals before Christ’s tribunal, in order to his passing a
righteous sentence upon them. Whether the charge of their
apostacy from God, shall be again renewed, and hereby sin
traced to the very first spring and fountain of it, we know not:
but all the guilt that they have contracted since they were,
by a former sentence, cast out of heaven, shall be laid to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>charge: all that they have done against the interest of God in
the world, begun in the seduction of our first parents, and continued
ever since, with all those methods of revenge and subtilty
whereby they have opposed the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and endeavoured to ruin his people, will be alleged
against them, as well as the bold attempt they made on him in
his own Person, whilst he was in a state of humiliation. Thus
the fallen angels, though represented as cast down to hell, are
yet said to <i>be delivered into chains of darkness, and reserved
unto judgment</i>, 2 Pet. ii. 4. Jude, ver. 6. This they are, at present,
apprehensive of, and are accordingly said <i>to tremble</i>, Jam.
ii. 19. at the fore-thoughts of it: it may also be inferred from
what they said to our Saviour, <i>Art thou come to torment us before
the time</i>, Matt. viii. 29. and, as the result hereof, it is said,
that <i>the devil was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone</i>, Rev.
xx. 10. <i>i. e.</i> adjudged to endure a greater degree of torment in
proportion to the increase of his guilt.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which is more particularly insisted on in scripture,
in which we are immediately concerned, is what relates to men,
as those who are to be judged by Christ. This is set forth in
universal terms; the apostle says, <i>We must all appear before
the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether
it be good or bad</i>, 2 Cor. v. 10. men of all ranks and conditions,
<i>small and great</i>, Rev. xx. 12. <i>quick and dead</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 1. <i>i. e.</i>
those who died before, or shall be found alive at his coming,
<i>the righteous and the wicked</i>, Eccl. iii. 17. and among these,
not only them that have lived under the gospel-dispensation;
but others, who have had no other light but that of nature; <i>As
many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law</i>,
Rom. ii. 12. We have no account, indeed, in scripture, of their
being adjudged to eternal life, for their doing, by nature, some
things that are contained in the law; to suppose this, is to be
wise above what is written; and, indeed, it seems contradictory
to those scriptures which assert the necessity of faith in Christ
to salvation; but these are generally described as suffering
punishment proportioned to their works. Thus we read of the
<i>men of Nineveh</i>, Matt. xii. 41. <i>the queen of the South</i>, ver. 42.
<i>the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon</i>, chap. xi. 22. and those of
Sodom and Gomorrah, ver. 24. as <i>appearing in judgment</i>, and
exposed to a less degree of punishment than those that sinned
against greater light; but there is not the least intimation given
of their being discharged from condemnation. Our Saviour, indeed,
speaks of the ‘servant which knew his master’s will, and
prepared not himself to do according to it, who should be
beaten with many stripes,’ <i>i. e.</i> exposed to a greater condemnation;
nevertheless, he, at the same time, intimates that <i>the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>servant who did not know</i>, <i>i. e.</i> who sinned under greater disadvantages
for want of gospel-revelation, even he <i>should be
beaten with few stripes</i>; or adjudged to suffer a less degree of
punishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pelagians, indeed, have endeavoured not only to exempt
the Heathen from the consequences of this judgment; but some
have insinuated as though they were not concerned in it at all:
thus one<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a> supposes, that the persons who are represented as
appearing at Christ’s tribunal, Matt. xxv. and sentenced, by
him, according to their works, are only those who made a profession
of the Christian religion. And the principal argument
that he brings to support this opinion is, because they, on whom
a sentence of condemnation is passed, are accused of not ministering
to Christ’s members, which is interpreted as not giving
him meat, when he was hungry, or drink when he was
thirsty, <i>&amp;c.</i> which charge could not have been brought against
those that never heard of Christ; or if it had, they might have
excused themselves by alleging that it was impossible for them
to shew this respect to him whom they never knew. But to
this it may be replied, that though our Saviour’s design here,
is to aggravate the condemnation of those who sinned under
the gospel, and to charge some with crimes of the highest nature;
yet there is nothing mentioned, exclusive of others, so as
to give occasion to suppose that the judgment of the great day
will respect only those who have set under the sound of the
gospel. Therefore we have ground to conclude, that as the resurrection
of the dead will be universal; so all that have lived,
or shall live, from the beginning to the end of time, shall be
the subjects of the judicial proceedings in that solemn and awful
day; which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. The manner in which Christ shall proceed in judging
the world. It is evident, that the design of this glorious transaction
is to determine the final state of all men, which will be
done in a public and visible manner, that it may appear that
the Judge of all does right: this differs very much from that
particular judgment that is passed on every one at death; in
which, though their state be unalterably determined, yet it is
not done in an open and visible manner; but with a design that
the cause should be tried again in that day which is appointed
for it. The account we have in scripture, of the manner in
which this shall be done, bears some resemblance to the proceedings
in human courts of judicature; accordingly the day
is set in which causes are to be tried; the Judge appears with
the ensigns of his authority; and being seated on the tribunal,
the persons to be tried appear before him; the cause is heard;
and since all are to be judged according to law, the law is supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>to be known, or the particular statute, which is the rule
of judgment, must be produced; and whatever charge is to be
brought against any one, it is drawn up in the form of an indictment,
and supported by sufficient evidence, and the persons
hereupon acquitted or condemned. In allusion hereunto we
read of Christ’s appearing in a visible manner, seated on a
throne of judgment; or, as it is expressed, of <i>the Son of man</i>,
as <i>appearing with all the holy angels with him</i>; and his <i>sitting
upon the throne of his glory, and all nations being gathered before
him</i>, Matt. xxv. 31, 32. <i>the judgment seat, and the books
opened</i>, Dan. vii. 26. Rev. xx. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>The righteous, who are a part of those that shall stand before
Christ’s tribunal, shall be separated from the wicked; the
former placed at his right hand, the latter at his left. With
respect to the wicked, an indictment shall be brought in, in
which they shall be charged with the violation of the holy law
of God, with all the aggravating circumstances thereof, the
subject-matter of which is contained in the books that are said
to be opened. And this charge shall be supported by evidence;
in which case men shall be witnesses against one another, so
far as they have been apprised of each other’s behaviour, or
immediately concerned therein: and it is not improbable, that
since the holy angels are conversant in this lower world, as
they are sometimes represented as being present in worshipping
assemblies, 1 Cor. xi. 10. and observing the actions of
men, 1 Tim. v. 21. that they shall appear as evidences against
the wicked. And it may be farther observed, that the Judge
himself will be a witness against the criminals, which is not
usual in human courts of judicature; though it does not savour
of the least injustice: thus it is said, ‘I will come near to you
to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers,
and against the adulterers, and against false swearers,
and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the
widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger
from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts,’ Mal.
iii. 5. The divine Omniscience will put the charge out of all
manner of doubt; from whence there can be no appeal; since
it is impossible for God, either to be deceived himself, or to
deceive others.</p>

<p class='c006'>But besides this, there shall also be the testimony of conscience,
whereby persons shall stand self-convicted; their ‘own
hearts shall condemn them,’ as well as ‘God, who is greater
than their hearts,’ 1 John iii. 20. Thus it is said, that ‘the consciences
of men bear witness, and their thoughts, in the mean
while, accuse or else excuse one another, in the day when
God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ;’ and accordingly
‘every mouth shall be stopped, and all the world’ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the ungodly ‘become guilty,’ Rom. ii. 15, 16. or appear, by
their own confession, to be so, <i>before God</i>, chap. iii. 19. And in
order hereunto, there shall be a particular dispensation of providence,
whereby those sins which have been long since forgotten,
shall be brought to remembrance: this seems intimated
in our Saviour’s words in the parable; ‘Son, remember that
thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things,’ <i>&amp;c.</i> Luke
xvi. 25. and also in God’s <i>setting the iniquities</i> of sinners <i>in
order before their eyes</i>, Psal. l. 21. and this will have a greater
tendency to support the charge, than ten thousand witnesses.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the things that shall be brought into judgment, or be
charged, and proved upon them; these are mentioned in a very
particular manner, as it is said, ‘God shall bring every work
into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or
whether it be evil,’ Eccl. xii. 14. And elsewhere, he is represented
as ‘executing judgment upon all, and convincing all
that are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, which they have
ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him,’ Jude, ver. 15. And
our Saviour particularly intimates, Matt. xxv. 42, 43. that their
behaviour, under the means of grace, shall be enquired into,
and what they have done against him, and his interest in the
world, alleged against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now we are speaking concerning those matters which
shall be produced in judgment against the wicked, it may be
enquired; whether the smallest sins committed by them, shall
be brought into judgment against them? This seems to be intimated
by our Saviour, when he says, that ‘every idle word
that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the
day of judgment,’ chap. xii. 36. on which some take occasion
to complain of the severity of the divine dispensations, as
though it was intended hereby, that persons shall be condemned
to suffer eternal punishments for a vain thought: but to
this it may be replied, that no one will bring this as an objection
against the methods of the divine proceedings in the great
day, who duly considers the infinite evil of sin; or, that the
least sin deserves a sentence of banishment from God, as it is
an affront to his sovereignty, and opposite to his holiness. However
let it be considered that no person in the world shall have
reason to complain that he is separated from God, or rendered
eternally miserable, only for a vain thought, or a sin of infirmity,
as though he had been guilty of nothing else: therefore,
when our Saviour says, that ‘every idle word shall come into
judgment,’ the meaning is, that this shall tend to fill up the
measure of their iniquity; so that the punishments which they
shall be exposed to, shall be for this, in conjunction with all
other sins. Every sin brings guilt with it; and all sins taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>together, smaller, as well as greater, enhance the guilt: therefore,
our Saviour’s meaning is this, that every sin exposes men
to a degree of condemnation, in proportion to the aggravation
thereof; though they which are of a more heinous nature,
bring with them a greater degree of condemnation. Thus concerning
the charge brought against the wicked.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing to be considered is, the trial of the righteous,
who are said to stand before Christ’s judgment-seat. Here it
may be observed, that no indictment shall be brought against
them, at least, with the judge’s approbation; for they have been
before this acquitted and discharged, when brought into a justified
state; and therefore, as the consequence hereof, <i>none</i>, as
the apostle says, <i>shall lay any thing to their charge</i>, since <i>it
is God that justifieth</i>, Rom. viii. 33. If any thing be alleged
against them by the enemies of God, who loaded them with
reproach, and laid many things to their charge in this world,
of which some have been just, and others unjust and malicious:
I say, if these things should be suffered to be alleged
against them, the great and merciful Judge will appear as an
advocate for, and vindicate them from those charges which are
ungrounded; and will farther allege, as a foundation of their
discharge from the guilt of all others, that he has made a full
atonement for them; upon which account, when they are sought
for, they shall not be found in judgment, or charged upon them
to their shame, confusion, or condemnation; but they shall be
pronounced righteous, as interested in Christ’s righteousness;
and this shall be evinced by his producing those graces which
are inseparably connected with, though not the foundation of
their justification, that so the method of the divine proceedings,
in this respect, may be vindicated, and it may appear, that as
it is said, without holiness no one shall see the Lord; so these
are holy, and therefore they have this internal quality, which
denotes them such whom God designed to save: this I take to
be the meaning of that expression of our Saviour to the righteous,
when he pronounces them blessed, and invites them to
<i>come and inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation
of the world: for I was an hungred and ye gave me
meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink</i>, &amp;c. Matt. xxv. 34,
35. where the word <i>for</i> is taken demonstratively, and, not
casually; and denotes that they were such who might expect
to be admitted to this honour and blessedness, as having those
marks and characters of his children upon them, to which the
promise of salvation was annexed; not as though any thing
done by them was the cause of it. From hence it appears, that
the graces of God’s people shall be published before angels
and men, to the praise of the glory of him who was the author
of them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>But there is a difficult question which is proposed by some,
namely, whether the sins of God’s people shall be published in
the great day; though it is certain they shall not be alleged
against them to their condemnation? This is one of the secret
things which belong to God, which he has not so fully or clearly
revealed to us in his word; and therefore we can say little more
than what is matter of conjecture about it. Some have thought
that the sins of the godly, though forgiven, shall be made manifest,
that so the glory of that grace which has pardoned them,
may appear more illustrious, and their obligation to God for
this, farther enhanced. They also think that the justice of the
proceedings of that day, requires it; since it is presumed and
known by the whole world, that they were prone to sin, as well
as others; and, before conversion, as great sinners as any; and
after it their sins had a peculiar aggravation: therefore, why
should not they be made public, as a glory due to the justice
and holiness of God, and being infinitely opposite to all sin?
And this they farther suppose to be necessary, that so the impartiality
of divine justice may appear. Moreover, since God
by recording the sins of his saints in scripture, has perpetuated
the knowledge thereof; and if it is to their honour that the sins
there mentioned were repented of, as well as forgiven, why
may it not be supposed that the sins of believers shall be made
known in the great day? And besides, this seems agreeable to
those expressions of every word, and every action, as being to
be brought into judgment; whether it be good, or whether it
be bad, as in the scripture before-mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is supposed by others, that though the making known
of sin that is subdued and forgiven, tends to the advancement
of divine grace; yet it is sufficient to answer this end, as far as
God designs it shall be answered, that the sins which have been
subdued and forgiven, should be known to themselves, and this
forgiveness afford matter of praise to God. Again, the expressions
of scripture, whereby forgiveness of sin is set forth, are
such as seem to argue, that those sins which were forgiven,
shall not be made manifest; thus they are said to be <i>blotted
out</i>, Isa. xliii. 25. <i>covered</i>, Psal. xxxii. 1. <i>subdued</i>, and <i>cast into
the depths of the sea</i>, Micah vii. 19. and <i>remembered no more</i>,
&amp;c. Jer. xxxi. 34. Besides, Christ’s being a Judge, doth not
divest him of the character of an advocate, whose part is rather
to conceal the crimes of those whose cause he pleads, than
to divulge them. And to this we may add, that the law which
requires duty, and forbids the contrary sins, is not the rule by
which they who are in Christ, are to be proceeded against;
for then they could not stand in judgment; but they are dealt
with according to the tenor of the gospel, which forgives and
covers all sin. And furthermore it is argued, that the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>declaring of all their sins before the whole world, notwithstanding
their interest in forgiving grace, would fill them with
such shame, as is hardly consistent with a state of perfect
blessedness. And lastly, the principal argument insisted on, is,
that our Saviour in Matt. xxv. in which he gives a particular
account of the proceedings of that day, makes no mention of
the sins, but only commends the graces of his saints. Such-like
arguments as these are alleged to prove that it is probable the
sins of the saints shall not be exposed to public view, in the
great day. But after all that has been said, it is safest for us
not to be too peremptory in determining this matter, lest, by
pretending to be wise beyond what is clearly revealed in scripture,
we betray our own folly, and too bold presumption, or
assert that which is not right of this glorious Judge. Thus concerning
the method in which Christ shall proceed in judging
the world. We are now led to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. Some circumstances relating to the place where, and the
time when, this great and awful work shall be performed, at
least, so far as it is convenient for us to enquire into this matter,
without giving too much scope to a vain curiosity, or desire
to be wise above what is written. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the place; it does not seem probable that it shall
be upon the surface of the earth; because we read, that <i>they
which are</i> found <i>alive</i> at Christ’s coming, <i>shall be caught up together
with them</i>, that is, the others who are raised from the
dead, <i>in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air</i>; which immediately
follows after the account which the apostle gives of the
Lord’s <i>descending from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
the arch-angel, and with the trump of God</i>, 1 Thes. iv. 16, 17.
which is the signal to be given of the immediate appearance of
the Judge: therefore, their being <i>caught up in the clouds</i>, denotes
that Christ shall judge the world, in some place above
this earth; otherwise they must be supposed to be caught up
thither, and afterwards obliged to descend from thence, to the
place from whence they were taken, to be judged; which does
not seem probable. This is all that we dare assert, concerning
the place where this great and solemn transaction shall be performed.</p>

<p class='c006'>And I the rather observe this, because some are of opinion,
that the valley of Jehoshaphat is designed to be the place, from
the application of that prediction mentioned in the prophet Joel,
in chap. iii. 2. <i>I will gather all nations, and will bring them
down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them
there for my people</i>:<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a> but that seems to be a prophesy of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>signal victory which the church should gain over its enemies;
which shall have its accomplishment before Christ come to
judgment, and be no less remarkable than that which God
gave Jehoshaphat over the Moabites, Ammonites, and the inhabitants
of mount Seir, mentioned in 2 Chron. xx. upon which
occasion the place where it was obtained, was called <i>the valley
of Berachah</i>, which signifies blessing: and the prophet does not
seem by <i>the valley of Jehoshaphat</i>, to point out any particular
place known by that name; but rather to allude to the signification
of the word, as importing the judgment of the Lord:
so that nothing else is intended by it but that God shall, in the
latter day, probably when those scriptures shall have had their
accomplishment, which relate to the conversion of the Jews, execute
some remarkable judgment against the heathen, amongst
whom they were scattered. Therefore it cannot, with the least
shadow of justice, be argued from hence, that this is the place
where all nations of the earth shall be gathered to judgment.
Besides, some have observed, that how great soever this valley
may be, it is not large enough to hold the vast multitudes that
shall be convened on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what concerns the time when Christ shall judge the
world; this is called, in scripture, <i>a day</i>, Acts xvii. 31. not to
signify that the whole work shall be performed in that space
of time, which we generally call <i>a day</i>; for that can hardly be
sufficient for the performing the many things that are to be
done in it. Some have thought that the whole process shall
take up no less than a thousand years; and suppose, that the
apostle Peter intimates as much, when speaking concerning the
day of judgment, he says, <i>One day is with the Lord as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 8. Thus
the excellent Mr. Mede understands that scripture:<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c013'><sup>[189]</sup></a> but since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>this is not more clearly explained by other scriptures, speaking
to the same purpose, I dare not be too peremptory in giving
into this opinion; but would rather conclude, that the time
of the continuance thereof, is called <i>a day</i>, as denoting a season
appointed for the dispatch of a work, whether it be longer
or shorter. Thus Christ calls that season, in which the gospel
was preached to the Jews, <i>their day</i>, Luke xix. 42. And therefore
it is the safest way for us to acknowledge this to be a secret
which belongs not to us to enquire into.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the time when Christ shall come to judgment, or when
this glorious day shall begin, that is also considered, not only
as a matter kept secret from us, but from all creatures: thus
our Saviour, speaking concerning it, says, ‘Of that day and
hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my
Father only,’ Matt. xxiv. 36. This is particularly intimated
in the answer we are explaining; and the reason assigned why
it is kept secret from us, <i>viz.</i> that all may watch and pray, and
be ready for the coming of the Lord; which is certainly a matter
of the highest importance; and it is evident, that if God
had either revealed the time of Christ’s coming to judgment,
or let men know how long they should continue in this world,
before that judgment, which is past on all at death, it might
have given occasion to the corruption of our nature, to have
put off all thoughts about it, till it was at hand: therefore our
Saviour, in wisdom, as well as kindness to his people, has represented
his coming under the similitude of <i>a thief in the
night</i>, 2 Thes. v. 2. and accordingly says, <i>Therefore be ye also
ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh</i>,
Matt. xxiv. 44. Thus concerning the day of judgment. As
to what respects the consequence hereof, and the sentence which
shall be pronounced on the righteous and the wicked, that is
the subject-matter of the two following answers.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that I shall add at present is, some practical inferences
from this doctrine of Christ’s coming to judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) What has been observed concerning Christ’s coming to
judge the world in his own glory, and that of his Father, and
of his holy angels, should fill us with high and honourable
thoughts of him; and since the angels reckon it an honour to
attend him as ministering spirits in that great day, this should
excite in us an holy ambition to approve ourselves his servants
in all things, and to account it our honour that he will esteem
us such.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Since Christ at his coming to judgment, will bring all
things to light, and impartially state and try the cause of every
one, who shall be rewarded according to their works; this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>should silence, and fence against, all unbelieving thoughts,
which may arise in the minds of men, concerning the seemingly
unequal distributions of providence, in God’s dealing
with the righteous and the wicked, as to what respects the outward
affairs of life, and make us easy, though we know not
his design in the various afflictive providences wherewith we
are exercised; since we are not to expect those blessings here,
which he has reserved for his people, at Christ’s appearing to
judgment; which, if he is pleased to bestow upon us hereafter,
we shall then have the highest reason to admire his wisdom,
goodness, and faithfulness, in the whole method of his providential
dealings with us.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) This doctrine tends to reprove the atheism and profaneness
of those, who make a jest of, or scoff, at the day of judgment;
like those the apostle Peter mentions, whom he calls
<i>scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is
the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all
things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation</i>,
2 Pet. iii. 3, 4. It also reproves those who abuse the day of
God’s patience; and because his coming to judgment is delayed,
take occasion to commit the vilest crimes. Thus our Saviour
speaks of some as doing, and intimates that he will <i>come
in a day when they look not for him, and shall cut them asunder,
and appoint them their portion with hypocrites</i>, Matt. xxiv.
48-51.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) This doctrine should stir us up to universal holiness,
and the greatest circumspection and diligence in the service of
God; as the apostle says, when speaking concerning Christ’s
coming to judgment, with those displays of terrible majesty
that shall attend it, <i>what manner of persons ought we to be, in
all holy conversation and godliness, looking for, and hasting unto
the coming of the day of God</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 11, 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Since we expect that Christ will judge the world at the
last day, it behoves us to be often judging and trying ourselves,
examining how matters stand between God and us; and whether
we behave ourselves in such a way as that we may be meet for
Christ’s coming, and have boldness in the day of judgment; as
the apostle says, <i>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 31. that is, with the judgment of condemnation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) It is an inexpressible advantage when we can conclude,
upon good grounds, that this great Judge is our Friend, our
Saviour, our Advocate, and that, living and dying, we shall be
found in him; for then, though he come in such a way as will
strike the utmost terror and confusion into his enemies, we
shall be found of him in peace: and the consequence of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>day’s solemnity shall be our admission into his immediate presence,
and being for ever blessed therein.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-89' class='c003'>Quest. LXXXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. LXXXIX.</span> <i>What shall be done to the wicked at the
day of judgment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> At the day of judgment the wicked shall be set on
Christ’s left hand; and upon clear evidence, and full conviction
of their own consciences, shall have the fearful, but just
sentence of condemnation pronounced against them; and
thereupon shall be cast out from the favourable presence of
God, and the glorious fellowship with Christ, his saints, and
all his holy angels, into hell, to be punished with unspeakable
torments both of body and soul, with the devil and his
angels for ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having, under the last answer, taken a view of Christ,
as coming to judgment; and the whole world as seated
at his tribunal, the wicked on his left hand, and the righteous
on his right; the books opened, the cause tried, and the evidence
produced; we are now to consider the sentence that will
be past on each of them, together with the consequences thereof:
and particularly we have an account in this answer, of a
sentence of condemnation, pronounced against the wicked, and
the punishment inflicted on them, pursuant thereunto; which
our Saviour expresses in words full of dread and horror; <i>Then
shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed
into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment</i>, Matt. xxv.
41, 45. This includes in it an eternal banishment and separation
from him, in whose favour there is life. As sin is the object
of his detestation, it being contrary to the holiness of his
nature, they who are found in open rebellion against him, shall
not <i>stand in his sight</i>, Psal. v. 5. As they did not desire his
special and gracious presence, which his saints always reckoned
their chief joy, in this world; they shall be deprived of it in
the next. And when they are commanded to depart from him,
they are described as <i>cursed</i>, that is, bound over to suffer all
those punishments which the vindictive justice of God will inflict,
that are contained in those threatenings which are denounced
by his law that they have violated, and sent down into
hell, to be punished with unspeakable torments, both in body
and soul, with the devil and his angels, for ever. Accordingly
there are three things to be considered, relating to the punishment
of sinners in another world, namely, the kind thereof, its
degree, and eternal duration.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>I. As to the kind of punishment; that is generally considered
in two respects, namely, the punishment of loss and sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning the punishment of loss. This contains in it a
separation from God, the fountain of blessedness; a being destitute
of every thing that might administer comfort to them;
and, as the consequence hereof, they are deprived not only of
fellowship with Christ, but with his saints. Not that they were
ever the objects of their love or delight, but, on the other hand,
their conversation was distasteful and burdensome; especially
when it was in itself most savoury and spiritual: nevertheless,
it is reckoned to be one ingredient in their misery, as our Saviour
expresses it, when he speaks of the <i>workers of iniquity</i>,
as first commanded to <i>depart from him</i>, Luke xiii. 27, 28. and
then tells them, <i>Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves
thrust out</i>: where the happiness of others is considered as what
will raise their envy, and prove a torment to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There is the punishment of sense: this is set forth by
those unspeakable torments to be endured both in soul and
body; and because no pain is so exquisite as that which is occasioned
by fire, it is therefore called <i>unquenchable and everlasting
fire</i>, Matt. iii. 12. chap. xxv. 41. As for that enquiry
which some make, whether the fire be elementary or material,
like that which is in this world, it savours more of curiosity
than what tends to real advantage: and since it is called a
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels, some have a little
hesitated about this matter, as concluding it impossible for material
fire to affect spirits; but I am not desirous to enter too
far into this disquisition. It is, indeed, a hard matter for us to
determine whether, or how far a spirit is capable of the punishment
of sense, any otherwise than, as, by reason of its union
with the body, it has an afflictive sensation of the evils which
that immediately endures; and therefore, some have thought,
that when we read of the fire of hell, it is to be taken in a metaphorical
sense, to denote those punishments which are most
exquisite, and have a tendency to torment both soul and body
in different respects. The soul is to be tormented as the wrath
of God has an immediate access to it, to make it miserable:
and though this cannot be styled the punishment of sense in
the same respect as that is of which the body is the more immediate
subject; yet if we take the word <i>sense</i>, as importing
an intellectual perception of those miseries that it undergoes,
whereby it is made uneasy, and in a moral sense, subject to
pain, as we sometimes speak of the pain of the mind, as well
as that of the body, then it may be said to endure the punishment
of sense, though it be in a spiritual substance.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>There are various ways by which the wrath of God may
have access to the soul, to make it miserable; and this punishment
is sometimes compared to fire, as it is beyond expression
dreadful; and accordingly God, when inflicting it, is styled, <i>A
consuming fire</i>, Heb. xii. 29. and <i>his jealousy</i> is said elsewhere
to <i>burn like fire</i>, Psal. lxxix. 5. Therefore, some have described
the punishment of sin in hell, as including in it the insupportable
weight of the wrath of God lying on the consciences
of men, and sinking them into perdition; whereby it appears to
be <i>a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</i>, Heb.
x. 31. A judicious divine considers this as the effect of God’s
immediate presence, as a sin-revenging Judge; and therefore
understands that text, in which it is said, <i>They shall be punished
with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord</i>, 2
Thes. i. 9. not as denoting an exclusion from his comforting
presence, which is an undoubted truth, and the more generally
received sense thereof; but he speaks of the presence of God,
as well as his power, as the immediate cause of their destruction;
in like manner as when the Psalmist joins both these
ideas together, when he says, <i>Who knoweth the power of thine
anger</i>, Psal. xc. 11. and it seems most agreeable to the grammatical
construction of the words.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a> This is that punishment
which is more immediately adapted to the soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the punishment of sense, which the body shall endure,
whether it be compared unto fire, as containing in it some effects,
not unlike to those produced by fire; or, whether it only
signifies that the punishment shall be most exquisite, as no pain
is so terrible as that which is the effect of fire, I will not pretend
to determine. There are, indeed, other expressions by
which it is set forth in scripture, as well as fire, <i>viz.</i> <i>cutting
asunder</i>, Matt. xxiv. 51. <i>tearing in pieces</i>, Psal. l. 22. <i>drowning
men in destruction and perdition</i>, 1 Tim. vi. 9. <i>a being bound
hand and foot</i>, and <i>cast into outer darkness</i>, Matt. xxii. 13. or,
into <i>a furnace of fire</i>, chap. xiii. 42. or, <i>a lake of fire burning
with brimstone</i>, Rev. xix. 20. some of which are, doubtless,
metaphorical expressions, by which the punishment of sin is
set forth; but whether they are all so we must not be too positive
in determining: however, some suppose they are, because
the glory of heaven is described by the metaphors of <i>streets of
gold, gates of pearl</i>, Rev. xxi. 21. <i>rivers of pleasure</i>, &amp;c. Psal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>xxxvi. 8. and the wrath of God is metaphorically described,
when he is called <i>a consuming fire</i>, Heb. xii. 29. Therefore,
as the glory of heaven is represented by metaphors, denoting
that it is inconceivably great; so, if we suppose that the punishment
of sin in hell, is set forth by metaphorical ways of speaking,
we cannot from hence, in all respects, take an estimate of
the quality thereof; nevertheless we must conclude in general
from such-like expressions, by which it is represented, that it
is inexpressibly terrible, such as respects both soul and body,
which is called, as has been observed in different respects, the
punishment of sense. Which leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider this punishment, as to the degree thereof,
which is generally described as being various, in proportion to
the aggravations of sin committed; accordingly they who have
sinned under the gospel-dispensation, are considered as exposed
to a greater degree of punishment than others who have not
had those advantages. Thus the apostle says, <i>Of how much
sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
under foot the Son of God</i>, chap. x. 29. And our Saviour speaking
concerning the Scribes and Pharisees, who were notorious
hypocrites, whose religion was no more than a pretence, and
made subservient to the vilest practices, tells them, that <i>they
should receive the greater damnation</i>, Matt. xxiii. 14. that is, a
greater degree of punishment, as they had contracted greater
guilt than others: and the apostle speaks of some who had had
great advantages through the <i>riches of God’s goodness and forbearance</i>
towards them, but yet were <i>impenitent</i>, and hardened
in sin; these, says he, <i>treasure up unto themselves wrath against
the day of wrath</i>, Rom. ii. 5. that is, add greater degrees to
the punishment which they shall endure in another world.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are to consider the punishment, which sinners are
liable to in the world to come, as to its duration, in which respect,
it shall be without intermission, and eternal. That there
shall be no relaxation of punishment, may be proved from what
our Saviour says in the parable; in which the <i>rich man</i>, who
was tormented in flames, could not obtain <i>one drop of water to
cool his tongue</i>, Luke xvi. 26. Thus we read of those who are
said to <i>drink of the wine of the wrath of God</i>, which is <i>poured
out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation</i>; and that
<i>the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever</i>; and that
<i>they have no rest day nor night</i>, Rev. xiv. 10, 11. And our
Saviour speaks of the two main ingredients in the punishment
of sin; namely, the tormenting sense which conscience shall
have of the wrath of God due to it; and the punishment of
sense, which is compared to that that proceeds from fire, and
both are described as eternal; where <i>their worm dieth not, and
the fire is not quenched</i>, Mark ix. 44, 46, 48.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>That the punishment of sin in another world will be eternal,
may be argued from the impossibility of their obtaining a discharge
from the sentence of condemnation, under which they
are, unless satisfaction be given to the justice of God for sins
committed; but this cannot be given by the person that suffers;
inasmuch as his sufferings are due to him, pursuant to the sentence
of the judge, and agreeable to the demerit of sin; which
being, as it is usually expressed objectively infinite, because
committed against an infinite God, and containing a contempt
of his sovereignty and other perfections which are infinite;
therefore it deserves a punishment proportionable thereto. And
since the sufferings of finite creatures are no other than finite,
and consequently bear no proportion to the demands of infinite
justice, they must be infinite in duration, that is, eternal. It
may also be observed, that at the same time that persons are
suffering for past sins, they are committing others. This is not
like God’s furnace, which is in Zion; whereby he designs not
to consume, but to refine and purge away the dross and the
tin; for it cannot, in any instance be said, that this is overruled
for good. Therefore the habits of sin are increased rather
than weakened thereby; and consequently sinners are set at a
farther distance from God, from holiness and happiness; which,
because it is still increasing, their punishment must be eternal.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that there is no Mediator appointed
between God and them; none who has undertaken to pay this
debt for them, and procure their discharge, as the apostle says
concerning those who have <i>sinned wilfully after they had received
the knowledge of the truth; there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sin</i>, Heb. x. 26. no advocate to plead their cause; no
ordinances in which the glad tidings of salvation are published,
nor any golden sceptre of mercy held forth to invite them to
come in, or give them hope of finding acceptance in the sight
of God; no covenant of grace that contains any promise that
will afford relief; and no inclination, in their own souls, to return
to God with an humble sense of sin, and desire to forsake
it, and from hence arises everlasting despair, beyond expression
tormenting, which the apostle calls <i>blackness of darkness
for ever</i>, Jude ver. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a very awful and awakening subject; and many are
as little desirous to hear of these things, as the people were to
hear of the account which the prophet Isaiah gave them of approaching
judgments; and therefore they say, <i>Cause the holy
One of Israel to cease from before us</i>, Isa. xxx. 11. But since
there is such a passion in men as fear; and this is oftentimes
made subservient to their spiritual advantage, it pleases God,
in wisdom and mercy, sometimes to reveal those things in his
word, which have a tendency to awaken our fears, and to set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>before us death as well as life, the threatenings as well as the
promises, that hereby we may see it to be our duty and interest
to flee from the wrath to come; and to use those precautions
prescribed in the gospel, which may have a tendency, through
divine grace, to prevent our sinking into everlasting perdition.
They who cast off fear, and think themselves safe, because the
rod of God is not upon them, generally cast off a sense of duty,
and say unto God, <i>Depart from us; for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways</i>, Job xxi. 9, 14. Therefore these subjects
are to be insisted on as warnings to induce men to avoid
the rock on which multitudes have split and perished; not to
lead them to despair. However, there is great need of prudence
in applying every truth in such a way as that it may be
of advantage; which renders the work of those that are employed
in preaching the gospel, exceeding difficult: every one
must have those doctrines inculcated and applied to him, that
are adapted to his respective condition, as well as founded on
the word of God; and therefore we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That such subjects as these, though they are not to be concealed,
as being a part of the counsel of God, and a means ordained
by him, to answer some valuable end; yet they are not
only, or principally to be insisted on, as though there were no
passion to be wrought upon but fear. It is the stupid person
that is to be awakened out of his lethargy, by violent methods:
the man that says, I shall have peace, though I walk according
to the corrupt inclinations of my own heart; the danger is over;
or that no ill consequences will attend that wilful impenitency
and unbelief, which is like to prove destructive to him; or, if
a person is willing to deceive himself, and endeavours to extenuate
his sin, apprehending the consequences thereof not to
be so pernicious as they really are; or, that the mercy of God
will save him, though remaining in open rebellion against him,
as though there were no arrows in his quiver, or vials of wrath
to be poured forth on his enemies. Such ought to be dealt with,
by representing God as a consuming fire, with whom is terrible
majesty; and they must be told of the punishment of sin in
this and another world, that they may see their danger before
it be too late to escape. If it be said, that the terrors of God
have a tendency to drive persons to despair. To this it may be
replied, that the persons we are speaking of, are so far from
despairing of the mercy of God, that they are inclined to abuse
it; and that which is like to be their ruin, is the contrary extreme,
<i>viz.</i> presumption; which leads them to turn the grace
of God into wantonness.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As for others, who are humbled under a sense of sin,
whose flesh trembles for fear of God’s judgments, there is not
so much occasion to insist on these awakening subjects, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>we have to do with them; for this would be like adding fuel
to the fire. If the heart be broken and contrite, and is apt to
meditate little else but terror; then such subjects are to be insisted
on as are encouraging. Thus when the prophet Jeremiah
had been reproving the people for their abominations, and
threatening many sore judgments which God would execute
upon them, he applies healing medicines; <i>Is there no balm in
Gilead? Is there no physician there? why then is not the health
of the daughter of my people recovered?</i> Jer. viii. 22. And
elsewhere when he had been reprehending them for their idolatry,
and putting them in mind of those judgments they had
exposed themselves to; he encourages them to <i>cry unto God,
my Father, thou art the guide of my youth: Will he reserve his
anger for ever? Will he keep it to the end?</i> Jer. iii. 4, 5. It is
God’s usual method in dealing with sinners, first to excite their
fear by charging sin on the conscience, and putting them in
mind of the dreadful consequences thereof; in which respect,
as the apostle expresses, <i>The law enters that the offence might
abound</i>; and then he shews him, that the soul may take encouragement,
when humbled under a sense of its own guilt;
that <i>where sin has abounded, grace did much more abound</i>, Rom.
v. 20. The gospel is designed to administer comfort to those,
who are distressed under a dread of the wrath of God. Therefore,
there are promises as well as threatenings; and each of
these are to be applied as the occasion requires it; so that the
happiness of heaven is to be set in opposition to the punishment
of sin in hell; and accordingly as the answer we have been explaining,
contains a very awful and awakening subject; so, in
the next, we are led to consider a doctrine which is full of
comfort to those who have an interest in Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-90' class='c003'>Quest. XC.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> XC. <i>What shall be done to the righteous at the day of
judgment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> At the day of judgment, the righteous being caught up
to Christ in the clouds, shall be set on his right hand, and
there openly acknowledged, and acquitted; shall join with
him in the judging of reprobate angels and men, and shall be
received into heaven; where they shall be fully and for ever
freed from all sin and misery, filled with unconceivable joys,
made perfectly holy and happy, both in body and soul, in
the company of innumerable saints, and holy angels, but
especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the
Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to
all eternity: and this is the perfect and full communion which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the members of the invisible church shall enjoy with Christ
in glory at the resurrection and day of judgment.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have, in this answer, an account of the great honours
and privileges that the saints shall be advanced to, and
partake of, as the consequence of that sentence that Christ will
pass on them, <i>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world</i>, Matt.
xxv. 34. which are words that contain a gracious invitation
given them to take possession of that glory which will tend to
make them completely and for ever happy. We have already
considered the righteous as caught up to Christ in the clouds,
which is either done by the ministry of angels, or else their
bodies will be so changed, that they shall be able to mount upward,
with as much ease as they are, now to walk upon the
surface of the earth. We have also considered them as set at
Christ’s right-hand. Whether this has any regard to the place
of their situation, we cannot determine; but, according to the
scripture mode of speaking, it certainly denotes the highest
honours conferred upon them; which will be not only spiritual
but external and visible; whereby it shall appear to all, that
they are Christ’s peculiar friends and favourites; and this will
tend to raise in them the highest astonishment, that they should
thus be dealt with by so glorious a person, who were in themselves
unworthy of his notice; and it shall afford matter of
eternal praise. What is farther observed concerning them in
this answer, is contained in the following heads.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. They shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. They shall join with Christ in the judging of reprobate
angels and men.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. They shall be received into heaven, in which their happiness
is farther described; as therein they shall be freed from
sin and misery, filled with unspeakable joy, made perfectly holy
and happy, both in body and soul, and admitted into the company
of saints and holy angels, and have the immediate vision
and fruition of God to all eternity.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. They shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted. Our
Lord Jesus was not ashamed to own his people, when he condescended
to take their nature upon him, and dwell among
them; or, as the apostle expresses it, <i>He is not ashamed to call
them brethren</i>, Heb. ii. 11. And he gives them many tokens of
his approbation, by those spiritual privileges which he bestows
on them here: but at last he shall own them publicly, in the
presence of the whole world, as a people whom he has chosen,
redeemed, sanctified, and brought the work of grace in them
to perfection. He overlooks all their former failures and defects,
and looks upon them as adorned with perfect beauty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>appearing without spot before him, and having now nothing
that may be offensive to his holy eye, or denote them unmeet
for the relation which they stand in to him, and the blessings
which they shall enjoy with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is said that he shall openly acquit them, <i>i. e.</i>
declare publicly, that he has given satisfaction for all their offences;
and therefore they are for ever pronounced clear from
the guilt thereof. And, as it was before observed, it is not improbable,
that their former sins shall not be so much as mentioned,
being all covered; and if sought for, shall not be found:
but it is certain, that if they shall be mentioned, it shall not be
to their confusion or condemnation; for it shall be declared,
that the justice of God has nothing to lay to their charge; and,
as the consequence thereof, they shall be delivered from that
fear, shame, and distress, which they had before been subject
to, through the afflicting sense of the guilt and prevalency of
sin: however, when they are represented as thus acquitted, this
does not suppose that their sins were not fully pardoned before,
or that justification in this life, is imperfect, as to what concerns
their right to forgiveness, or eternal life. The debt was fully
cancelled, and a discharge given into Christ’s hands, in the behalf
of all his elect, on his making satisfaction to the justice of
God; but this was not their visible discharge; and not being a
declared act, it could not be claimed by, nor was it applied to
them till they believed; and then they might say, Who shall
lay any thing to our charge? it is God that justifieth<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a>: nevertheless,
their justification, as it is declared to, and apprehended
by faith, could not be said to be in all respects, so apparent,
nor attended with those comfortable fruits and effects, which
are the consequence hereof, as it is when they are pronounced
justified by Christ at death; and even then the discharge is not
so open and visible to the whole world, as it shall be in the day
of judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It is farther said, that they shall join with Christ in judging
of reprobate angels and men: this is very often asserted by
those who treat on this subject; and it seems to be taken from
the sense which is commonly given of the apostle’s words in
1 Cor. vi. 2, 3. <i>Know ye not that saints shall judge the world</i>;
and, <i>know ye not that the saints shall judge angels?</i> However,
we must take heed, if we apply that scripture to the case before
us, that we do not advance any thing that tends, in the least, to
derogate from the glory of Christ, who only is fit for, and appointed
to perform this great work: therefore, if we suppose
that the apostle is here speaking concerning the judgment of
the great day, the saints are said to judge the world in a less
proper sense; but whatever be the sense in which we explain
it, we must not think that they shall be assessors with Christ in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>his throne of judgment: it is one thing for them to be near his
throne in the capacity and station of favourites; and another
thing for them to be in it: if they are in any sense said to judge
the world, it must not be understood, as though the trying of
the cause, or passing the sentence, were committed to them;
but rather of their approving what Christ shall do: this they
are represented as doing, when Christ is set forth as <i>judging
the great whore</i>, Rev. xix. 2. namely, the anti-christian powers;
they so far join with him herein, as that they ascribe glory and
honour to him, and say, <i>Righteous are his judgments</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there is another sense in which some understand this
scripture, concerning <i>the saints judging the world</i>, as denoting
that the public mention which shall be made of the graces of
the saints, their faith, repentance, love to God, and universal
holiness, will have a tendency to condemn those whose conversation
in this world has been the reverse thereof. Their having
forsaken all, and followed Christ, and accounted all things
but loss, that they might win him. The choice which they
have made of suffering rather than sinning, which appears to
be an instance of the highest wisdom, shall condemn the wickedness
and folly of those, who have exposed themselves to inevitable
ruin and misery, by being otherwise-minded. Thus
Noah is said to have <i>condemned the world by</i> his <i>faith</i>, Heb.
xi. 7. when, in obedience to the divine command, he <i>prepared
an ark to the saving of his house</i>, which the world then thought
to be the most preposterous action that ever was performed,
though they were afterwards, to their cost, convinced of the
contrary. And <i>the men of Nineveh, and the queen of the South</i>,
are said to <i>rise up in the judgment with that generation, and
condemn it</i>, Matt. xii. 41, 42. (to wit, objectively, rather than
formally,) as their respective behaviour tended to expose the
impenitency and unbelief of the Jews, whom Christ there reproves.
If the saints judging the world, be taken in either of
these senses, it is an undoubted truth: but more than this we
dare not assert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, we may take occasion to enquire, whether that
text, on which this doctrine is founded, may not be explained
in another sense, as denoting some privilege which the saints
were to enjoy in this world, when the empire should become
Christian; and accordingly, magistrates and judges should be
chosen out of the church, in which respect they should <i>judge
the world</i>. This seems, to me, the most probable sense of the
apostle’s words, as an excellent and learned writer understands
them<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c013'><sup>[192]</sup></a>; and it is very agreeable to the context, in which they
are dissuaded, in ver. 1. from <i>going to law before the unjust,
and not before the saints</i>, as signifying the inexpediency of exposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>those controversies, that ought to be compromised in
the church, before Heathen-magistrates, as though they thought
themselves unfit to judge the smallest matters, of which he here
speaks, not of capital offences, which were to be tried only by
the civil magistrate; and to enforce this advice, he says, <i>Know
ye not that the saints shall judge the world</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. It is objected to this sense of the text; that, at the
same time when <i>the saints</i> are said to <i>judge the world</i>, he
speaks of them as <i>judging angels</i>; which comes not within the
province of civil magistrates; though we suppose them to be
Christians.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that when the apostle
speaks of the <i>saints judging angels</i>; this is brought in occasionally,
the former sense of <i>judging</i> being more agreeable to
the context. But since he is insisting on an honour that should
be conferred on the church, he farther enlarges on that subject,
and so speaks of their <i>judging angels</i>, as denoting that the consequence
and success of the gospel would be an evident conviction
to the world, that the Devil’s empire was weakened,
that he had no right to reign over the children of disobedience,
as he before had done. Thus our Saviour speaks of Satan’s
kingdom being destroyed by the preaching and success of the
gospel, when he says, ‘Now is the judgment of this world;
now shall the prince of this world be cast out,’ John xii. 31.
And elsewhere it is said, ‘Now is come salvation and strength,
and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ;
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,’ Rev. xii. 10.
Moreover, the apostle may have a particular reference to their
power of casting out devils, not only in that, but in some following
ages, as our Saviour, promised they should have, before
he left the world, Mark xvi. 17. which is known to have
continued in the church till the third century<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. There is another scripture which seems to favour
this opinion, namely, that the saints shall judge the world in
the last day, <i>viz.</i> our Saviour’s words, in Matt. xix. 28. ‘Ye
which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of
man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;’ and
that which makes this sense more probable, is what he speaks
of in the following verse, as a reward which they, who had
‘forsaken all for his name’s sake,’ should enjoy, namely, ‘ye
shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting
life.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that our Saviour, in one
of these verses, may, without any strain on the sense of the
words, be understood as giving them to expect some honours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>that should be conferred on them here, and in the other, those
which they should receive in another world: As to the honours
which were to be conferred on them here, namely, their
<i>sitting on thrones</i>, &amp;c. This is said to be ‘in the regeneration,
when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,’ that
is, not when the Son of man shall come to judgment; but when
he shall enter into his state of exaltation, and sit at God’s right-hand.
And inasmuch as this was to be done for them <i>in the
regeneration</i>, it seems most applicable to the gospel-state; in
which, as the apostle says, ‘Old things are past away; behold,
all things are become new,’ 2 Cor. v. 17. agreeable to what
is foretold by the prophet, ‘Behold I create new heavens and
a new earth,’ Isa. lxv. 17. which may well be called <i>the regeneration</i>.
And, as for the apostles <i>sitting on thrones</i>, that
may signify the spiritual honours that should be conferred upon
them; so that however they might be despised by the world,
they should be reckoned, by all that entertain just notions of
things, the chief and most honourable men of the earth. And,
as to what respects their <i>judging the twelve tribes of Israel</i>,
that may be understood of their convicting the Jews, and condemning
them for their unbelief in crucifying Christ, and rejecting
and persecuting the gospel. This they might be said to
do, partly in the exercise of their ministry, and partly in the
success thereof, and, indeed, the gospel may be said to judge
men when it convicts and reproves them. If this be the sense
of the text, then it does not respect any honours which the apostles
should be advanced to in the day of judgment; and
consequently it does not appear from hence, that they, any
more than other saints, shall bear a part in judging the world,
either of angels or men.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The saints shall be received into heaven. This includes
in it their being brought into a glorious place, and state. Thus
the apostle calls it, <i>An house not made with hands</i>, 2 Cor. v. 1.
which, doubtless, far exceeds all the other parts of the creation:
For, as the earthly paradise far exceeded all other places in
this world, being planted immediately by God, and furnished
with every thing which might be delightful and entertaining
for man, for whom it was designed: so this must be supposed
to be the most glorious part of the frame of nature, as being
designed to be the place of the eternal abode of the best of
creatures; and indeed, whatever is called heaven in scripture,
comes short of it, this being styled, <i>the heaven of heavens</i>,
Psal. cxlviii. 4. it is also particularly described as <i>God’s throne</i>,
Isa. lxvi. 1. the place of his immediate residence, where he
displays his glory in an extraordinary manner. As for that
particular part of the universe, in which it is situate, it is neither
possible, nor of any advantage for us to determine, any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>otherwise than as it is described, as being above this lower
world. But the principal thing to be considered, is, the glory
of the state, into which the saints shall there be brought; which
is set forth in this answer, by variety of expressions.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Herein they shall be fully, and for ever, freed from all
sin and misery; which being inseparably connected, they are
delivered from both at once. As to what respects the guilt of
sin, this includes in it not only their being for ever discharged
from the guilt of past sins, which is contained in their being
openly acquitted, as was before observed, but their not contracting
guilt for the future; accordingly they are put into such
a state as that they shall be disposed, and enabled to yield sinless
obedience; and as they are presented without spot and
blemish before God, they shall never contract the least defilement,
or do any thing which shall render them unmeet for that
glory, to which they are advanced, afford matter of reproach
to them, or provoke God to cast them out of that place which
cannot entertain any but sinless creatures. Therefore it differs
not only from that sinless state in which man was created at
first, but that in which the angels were created, who were not
all confirmed in their state of holiness, so as to render it impossible
for any of them to fall; but this is the happiness of
glorified saints.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we may also infer from hence, that there shall be no
temptations to sin; none arising from themselves, since there
are no lusts, or remainders of corruption, to draw them aside
from God; and no temptations from others, since they are all
made perfectly holy. The soul meets with no temptations
from the body, as it often did, while it was subject to the infirmities
of nature, in this imperfect state. It shall never be liable
to any weakness, weariness, stupidity, nor any of those diseases
with which it is now oppressed; so that the soul shall
never meet with any temptations arising from thence, inasmuch
as the happiness of the body consists in its subserviency
to it, in all those things that may tend to promote its compleat
blessedness. Moreover, they are also considered as delivered
from all misery, whether personal, or relative. The afflictions
of believers are confined to this present state; therefore in heaven
‘God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed
away,’ Rev. xxi. 4. and nothing remains that may tend to
abate their happiness, or render the state in which they are, imperfect.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They shall be filled with inconceivable joys. Thus our
Saviour says to the man in the parable, who had improved the
talents he had been entrusted with; <i>Enter thou into the joy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>thy Lord</i>, Matt. xxv. 21, 23. and they are said not only to be
<i>presented faultless before the presence of the glory of Christ</i>;
but <i>with exceeding joy</i>, Jude, ver. 24. This is the necessary
result of a state of perfect blessedness; which cannot but administer
the highest satisfaction and comfort to those who are
possessed thereof; inasmuch as it not only answers, but even
exceeds their most raised expectations. These joys are not
indeed carnal, but spiritual; for as the greatest delight which
the saints have here, consists in the favour and love of God,
and in the bright rays of his glory shining into the soul, so
they shall be perfectly blessed with this hereafter, in which respect
their joy shall be full.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They shall be made perfectly holy and happy, both in
body and soul. The soul shall be unspeakably more enlarged
than it was before, as to all the powers and faculties thereof.
The understanding rendered more capable of contemplating
the divine perfections, and it shall be entertained with those
discoveries of the glory thereof, which, at present, we have
but a very imperfect knowledge of: It shall be fitted to behold
the wisdom of God in the works of creation and redemption,
and be led into the deep mysteries of his providence, and the
reason of the various dispensations thereof, which, though they
know not now, they shall know hereafter. The will shall be
perfectly free, having no corrupt nature to bias, or turn it aside,
from that which is its chief good and happiness; neither shall
it choose any thing, but what is conducive thereunto: There
are no remains of rebellion and obstinacy to be found therein,
but a perfect and entire conformity to the will of God. The
affections shall be perfectly regulated, and unalterably run in
a right channel, fixed upon the best objects, and not in the least
inclined to deviate from them. And, as for the body, that
shall be fitted for a state of perfection, as well as the soul; for
it shall be raised a spiritual, celestial, and glorious body, and
therefore perfectly adapted to be a partaker with the soul, of
that glory which the whole man shall be possessed of; and
sanctified to be a temple of the Holy Ghost for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. They shall be joined with the innumerable company of
the saints and holy angels. The apostle speaks of an <i>innumerable
company of angels, and the general assembly and church
of the first-born</i>, Heb. xii. 22, 23. to which we are said, in this
world, to <i>come</i> by faith; but hereafter these two assemblies
shall be joined together, and make one body, that so they may,
as they are represented doing, with one consent, <i>adore</i> and proclaim
the <i>worthiness, riches, wisdom, and strength of the lamb
that was slain, who lives for ever and ever</i>, Rev. v. 11, <i>&amp; seq.</i>
Now since the saints and angels are described as making up
the same body, and engaged in the same worship, some have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>taken occasion to enquire concerning the means by which they
shall converse together in another world; or, in what manner
this united body shall be made visible to each other; but these
things we must be content to be ignorant of in this present
state. However, as to the saints, they shall converse with one
another by the organ of sense and speech; for this is one of
the ends for which the body shall be raised and re-united to the
soul; and it may also be proved, from what we read of Moses
and Elias conversing with Christ at his transfiguration in such
a manner, Matt. xvii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for that question which some propose, relating to this
matter, <i>viz.</i> whether there shall be a diversity of languages in
heaven, as there is on earth? This we cannot pretend to determine.
Some think that there shall; and that as persons of all
nations and tongues, shall make up that blessed society, so they
shall praise God in the same language which they before used
when on earth; and that this worship may be performed with
the greatest harmony, and to mutual edification, all the saints
shall, by the immediate power and providence of God, be able
to understand and make use of every one of those different languages,
as well as their own. This they found on the apostle’s
words, in which he says, <i>That at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord</i>; which, they suppose, has a respect to the heavenly
state, because it is said to be done both by <i>those that are
in heaven, and those that are on earth</i>, Phil. ii. 10, 11. But
though the apostle speaks, by a metonymy, of different tongues,
that is, persons who speak different languages, being subject
to Christ, he probably means thereby persons of different nations,
whether they shall praise him in their own language in
heaven, or no.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore some conjecture, that the diversity of languages
shall then cease; inasmuch as it took its first rise from God’s
judicial hand, when he confounded the speech of those who
presumptuously attempted to build the city and tower of Babel;
and this has been, ever since, attended with many inconveniencies.
And, indeed, the apostle seems expressly to intimate
as much, when he says, speaking concerning the heavenly
state, that <i>tongues shall cease</i>, 1 Cor. xiii. 8. that is, the present
variety of languages. Moreover, since the gift of tongues
was bestowed on the apostles, for the gathering and building
up the church in the first age thereof, which end, when it was
answered, this extraordinary dispensation ceased; in like manner,
it is probable that hereafter the diversity of languages shall
cease<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c013'><sup>[194]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible there are some who object to this, that the
saints, understanding all languages, will be an addition to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>honour, glory, and happiness: but to this it may be answered,
that though it is, indeed, an accomplishment in this world, for
a person to understand several languages; that arises from the
subserviency thereof, to those valuable ends that are answered
thereby; but this would be entirely removed, if the diversity
of languages be taken away in heaven, as some suppose it will.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are some, who, it may be, give too much scope to a
vain curiosity, when they pretend to enquire what this language
shall be, or determine, as the Jews do, and with them, some of
the Fathers, that it shall be the Hebrew; since their arguments
for it are not sufficiently conclusive; which are principally these,
<i>viz.</i> That this was the language with which God inspired man
at first in paradise, and that which the saints and patriarchs
spake, and the church generally made use of in all ages, till
our Saviour’s time; and that it was this language which he
himself spake, while here on earth: and since his ascension into
heaven, he spake unto Paul <i>in the Hebrew tongue</i>, Acts xxvi.
14. And when the inhabitants of heaven are described in the
Revelations as praising God, there is one word used, by which
their praise is expressed, namely, Hallelujah, which is Hebrew;
the meaning whereof is, <i>praise ye the Lord</i>: but all these
arguments are not sufficiently convincing; and therefore we
must reckon it no more than a conjecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the opinion of those who suppose that it will not be
any particular language that is, or has been spoken in this world,
but one that is more perfect and significative, and that this is
what the apostle means when he speaks of <i>the tongues of angels</i>,
in 1 Cor. xiii. 1. To this it may be replied, that it is more
than probable, that there shall be some language which shall
be more perfect and significative than any that is now known
in the world; which glorified saints shall receive by immediate
inspiration; yet this does not fully appear to be the apostle’s
meaning in that scripture; since it is not certain that angels express
their ideas by the sound of words; inasmuch as they have
no bodies, nor organs of speech; neither can we certainly determine
that they frame voices some other way. Therefore, <i>the
tongue of angels</i>, which the apostle speaks of, is an hyperbolical
expression, signifying the most excellent language, or such
an one as angels would speak, did they use a voice; as <i>the face
of angels</i>, chap. vi. 15. is expressed to signify the most bright,
glorious, and majestic countenance; and as <i>manna</i> is called <i>angels
food</i>, Psal. lxviii. 25. that is, the most pleasant and delightful:
therefore <i>the tongue of angels</i> signifies the most excellent
language. But these things, though often enquired into
by those who treat on this subject, are very uncertain; neither
is it of any advantage for us to be able to determine them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is another thing arising from the consideration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>the saints being joined in one society, which is much more useful,
and, so far as we have light to determine it, will afford a
very comfortable and delightful thought to us, namely, what
concerns their knowing one another in heaven. The scripture,
indeed, does not so fully determine this matter as it does some
others, relating to the heavenly state; yet many of God’s children
have died with a firm persuasion that they shall see and
know their friends, in another world; and have been ready to
conclude this to be a part of that happiness which they shall
enjoy therein; and we cannot think this altogether an ungrounded
opinion; though it is not to be contended for as it
were a necessary and important article of faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arguments which are generally brought in defence of it,
are taken from those instances recorded in scripture, in which
persons who have never seen one another before, have immediately
known each other in this world, by a special immediate divine
revelation, given to them; in like manner as Adam knew
that Eve was taken out of him, and therefore says, <i>This is now
bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called woman,
because she was taken out of man</i>, Gen. ii. 23. He was
<i>cast into a deep sleep, when God took one of his ribs, and so
formed the woman</i>, as we read of in the foregoing words; yet
the knowledge hereof was communicated to him by God.
Moreover we read, that Peter, James, and John, knew Moses
and Elias, Matt. xvii. as appears from Peter’s making a particular
mention of them; <i>Let us make three tabernacles, one for
thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias</i>, ver. 4. though he
had never seen them before. Again, our Saviour, in the parable,
represents the <i>rich man</i> as seeing <i>Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom</i>, Luke xvi. 23. and speaks of him as addressing
his discourse to him. From such-like arguments some
conclude, that it may be inferred, that the saints shall know
one another in heaven, when joined together in the same assembly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, some think that this may be proved from the
apostle’s words, in 1 Thess, ii. 19, 20. <i>What is our hope or joy,
or crown of rejoicing? are not even ye in the presence of our
Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? for ye are our glory and
joy</i>; which seems to argue that he apprehended their happiness
in heaven should contribute, or be an addition to his, as
he was made an instrument to bring them thither; even so, by
a parity of reason, every one who has been instrumental in the
conversion, and building up others in their holy faith, as the
apostle Paul was with respect to them; these shall tend to enhance
their praise, and give them occasion to glorify God on
their behalf: therefore it follows, that they shall know one another;
and consequently they who have walked together in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>ways of God, and have been useful to one another, as relations
and intimate friends, in what respects more especially their spiritual
concerns, these shall bless God for the mutual advantages
which they have received, and consequently shall know one
another. Again, some prove this from that expression of our
Saviour in Luke xvi. 9. <i>Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
of unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they may receive you
into everlasting habitations;</i> especially if by these <i>everlasting
habitations</i> be meant heaven, as many suppose it is; and then
the meaning is, that they whom you have relieved and shewn
kindness to in this world, shall express a particular joy upon
your being admitted into heaven; and consequently they shall
know you and bless God for your having been so useful and
beneficial to them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Objec.</i> To this it is objected, that if the saints shall know one
another in heaven, they shall know that several of those who
were their intimate friends here on earth, whom they loved
with a very great affection, are not there; and this will have a
tendency to give them some uneasiness, and be a diminution
of their joy and happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that if it be allowed that
the saints shall know that some whom they loved on earth, are
not in heaven, this will give them no uneasiness, since that affection,
which took its rise principally from the relation which
we stood in to persons on earth, or the intimacy that we have
contracted with them, will cease in another world, or rather run
in another channel, and be excited by superior motives, namely,
their relation to Christ, and that perfect holiness which they
are adorned with, and their being joined in the same blessed
society, and engaged in the same employment, together with
their former usefulness one to another, in promoting their spiritual
welfare, as made subservient to the happiness they enjoy
there. And as for others who are excluded from their society,
they will think themselves obliged, out of a due regard to the
justice and holiness of God, to acquiesce in his righteous judgments:
thus the inhabitants of heaven are represented as adoring
the divine perfections, when the vials of God’s wrath
were poured out upon his enemies; and saying, <i>Thou art righteous,
O Lord, because thou hast judged thus: true and righteous
are thy judgments</i>, Rev. xvi. 5, 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Another ingredient in the glory of heaven, which is, indeed,
the greatest of all, is the saints enjoying the immediate
vision and fruition of God: this vision includes in it something
more than their beholding the human nature of Christ, as Job
speaks when he says, <i>In my flesh shall I see God</i>, Job xix. 26.
This, indeed, will be a delightful object, not only by reason of
the glory thereof, but from the love that they bear to his person,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>who, in that nature, procured for them the happiness which
they are advanced to. But the principal thing contained in this
vision of God, is, that it is contemplative and intellectual; for,
in other respects, he is invisible: nevertheless there are two
ways by which persons are said to see him; the one is by faith,
adapted to our present state; thus Moses is said to have <i>seen
him who is invisible</i>, Heb. xi. 27. that is, to contemplate, adore,
and improve the glory of the divine perfections so far as he is
pleased to manifest it to us in this world; but the other way
of beholding him is more perfect, as his glory is displayed with
the greatest clearness, and in the highest degree in heaven:
this the apostle opposes to that vision which we have of God
by faith, when he says, that in heaven <i>we shall see face to face,
and know even as we are also known</i>, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. that is,
we shall have more bright and immediate discoveries of the
glory of God; which, when represented by the metaphor of
<i>seeing face to face</i>, has some allusion to our knowing persons,
when we are in their immediate presence, which far exceeds
that knowledge which we had of them by report, when at a
distance from them: this the apostle expresses by such a mode
of speaking, as cannot well be understood in this imperfect
state, when he says,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c013'><sup>[195]</sup></a> <i>We shall see him as he is</i>, 1 John iii.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>2. which differs from those views which the saints have sometimes
had of the glory of God, when manifested in an emblematical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>way, in this world; they also behold it as shining forth
in its greatest effulgency.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Moreover, since the apostle speaks of this as a privilege
which should be enjoyed by the saints at Christ’s appearing,
who seems to be the object more especially here intended, it
may denote their beholding his mediatorial glory in its highest
advancement; and this view which they have of it, is said to
be assimilating, as well as delightful; and therefore he farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>adds, <i>We shall be like him</i>. And this shall also be satisfying:
thus the Psalmist says, <i>I will</i>, or shall, <i>behold thy face in righteousness;
when I awake I shall be satisfied with thy likeness</i>,
Psal. xvii. 15. How vastly does this differ from the brightest
views which the saints have of the glory of God here! It is
true they know something of him as he manifests himself in
the works of creation and grace; but this is very imperfect;
the object is not presented in its brightest lustre; nor is the
soul, which is the recipient thereof, enlarged, as it shall then
be to take in the rays of divine glory: however, though this
vision of God be unspeakable, and much more shall be known
of his perfections than we can attain to in this life; yet the
saints shall not have a comprehensive view thereof; for that is
not consistent with the idea of them as finite creatures. Thus
concerning the immediate vision of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is farther observed, that this vision is attended with fruition;
and therefore it is not barely speculative or contemplative,
but such as is felicitating; and accordingly the saints
know their interest in God, and see themselves to be the happy
objects of the former and present displays of the glory of his
perfections, and how they have all been exerted in bringing
them to, and fixing them in this blessed state; and from hence
arises that joy which accompanies this vision of God. And
besides this, there are some impressions of his glory on their
souls, which not only occasion, but excite this joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is farther observed, that this fruition is of God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The Father is beheld and enjoyed,
as his glory shines forth in the face of Christ, as bestowing
on his saints all the blessings which he has promised in
that everlasting covenant, which was established with, and in,
Christ, as their Head and Saviour; his purposes of grace, and
all his promises, having had their full accomplishment in him.
And the glory of Christ is beheld as the person to whom the
whole work of redemption, together with the application thereof,
was committed, and is now brought to perfection. And the
Holy Ghost is beheld as the person who has, by his power,
rendered every thing which was designed by the Father, and
purchased by the Son, effectual to answer the end which is now
attained, by shedding abroad the love of the Father and Son
in their hearts, dwelling in them as his temple, and in beginning,
carrying on, and perfecting that work, which is so glorious
in the effects and consequences thereof. In these respects
they have perfect and distinct communion with the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost; which far exceeds all they can have
here, and is infinitely preferable to all the delight which arises
from that enjoyment which they have of the blessed society
of perfect creatures to whom they are joined.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>6. The last ingredient in the happiness that believers shall
enjoy in heaven, is, that it shall be to all eternity. As the soul
is immortal, and the body, to which it shall be united, shall
be raised incorruptible; so the inheritance, which is reserved
in heaven for the saints is such as <i>fadeth not away</i>, 1 Pet. i. 4.
chap. v. 4. This will tend to make their happiness complete,
which nothing could do, were there not a full assurance of the
everlasting duration thereof. It would be a continual allay to
it, and a very uncomfortable thought to conclude, that though
their enjoyments are very great, yet they shall have an end.
The glory of heaven is not like the glories of this present world,
which are but for a moment, and, as it were, perish in the
using; nor like the state of holiness and happiness in which
God created man at first; which, through the mutability of
his nature, it was possible for him to lose: but it is established
by the decree of God, founded on the virtue of the blood of
Christ, who purchased for his people eternal redemption, and
in the covenant of grace settled this inheritance upon them, as
an everlasting possession. This is a doctrine so universally acknowledged,
that it is needless to insist on the proof of it; and
it is so frequently mentioned in scripture, that we scarce ever
read of the glory of heaven, but it is described as <i>eternal</i>, See
Jude ver. 6, and 21. Matt. xxv. 46. Tit. i. 2. Rom. vi. 22.
Gal. vi. 8. 1 Tim. i. 16. Psal. xvi. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one thing more, which, though it be not particularly
mentioned in this answer, I would not entirely pass over, that
is, what may be said to a question proposed by some, <i>viz.</i>
Whether there are degrees of glory in heaven? The Papists
not only maintain that there are, but pretend that greater degrees
thereof shall be conferred on persons, in proportion to
the merit of their good works here on earth; and therefore
have assigned to them the highest places there, who have performed
works of supererogation, by doing more than was strictly
enjoined them by the law of God. But all Protestant divines,
who allow that there are degrees of glory in heaven, strenuously
maintain that these are rewards of grace as every ingredient
in the heavenly blessedness is supposed to be. And when this
doctrine is made the subject of controversy among them; neither
side ought to contend for their particular opinion, as though
it was one of the most important articles of faith, or charge
them who defend the other side of the question, as though they
were maintaining something that was directly contrary to scripture,
or of a pernicious consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>They, on the other hand, who suppose that there are no degrees
of glory in heaven, are afraid, that if they should assert
the contrary, it would, in some measure, eclipse the glory of
the grace of God, and give too much umbrage to the Popish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>doctrine of the merit of good works. But this all Protestant
divines, as was but now observed, sufficiently fence against.
And, inasmuch as it is farther argued against degrees of glory,
that those external and relative privileges, which they enjoy,
such as election, justification, and adoption, belong equally and
alike to all saints; and the same price of redemption was paid
for all, therefore their glory shall be equal: this method of reasoning
will not appear very conclusive, if we consider that
sanctification is as much the result of their being elected, justified,
redeemed, and adopted, as their being glorified; but that
appears not to be equal in all, therefore it does not follow from
hence, that their glory, in a future state, shall be so. And
though their objective blessedness, which consists in that infinite
fulness of grace that there is in God, is inconsistent with
any idea of degrees; yet it does not follow, that the communications
resulting from hence, which are finite, shall be in a
like degree; nor can it be inferred from hence, that if there
are degrees of glory, the state of those who have the least degree,
shall be imperfect in its kind, or have any thing in it
which shall afford the least abatement of their happiness, or be
the occasion of envy or uneasiness, as the superior excellencies
of some, in this imperfect state, often appear to be, since that
is inconsistent with perfect holiness: nor is it to be supposed
that there are any degrees, with respect to the deliverance of
the saints from the sins, guilt, and miseries of this present life,
which is equal in all; nor do they, who think that there are
degrees of glory in heaven, in the least insinuate that every one
shall not be perfectly filled and satisfied, in proportion to his
receptive disposition; as a small vessel, put into the ocean, is
equally full, in proportion to its capacity, with the largest; and
therefore none of the saints will desire, nor, indeed, can contain
more than God designs to communicate to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for that scripture which is sometimes brought in defence
of this opinion, <i>viz.</i> the parable of the persons that were hired
to work in the <i>vineyard</i>, in Matt. xx. 9. in which it is said, that
<i>they that were hired about the eleventh hour, received every man
a penny</i>, which is as much as others received who were hired
early in the morning, and had <i>born the heat and burden of the
day</i>; that does not sufficiently prove it, since some of these labourers
are represented as <i>murmuring</i>, and insinuating that
they had wrong done them, to whom Christ replies, <i>Is thine
eye evil, because I am good?</i> and they are described as <i>called</i>,
but <i>not chosen</i>, ver. 15, 16. Therefore it is not designed to set
forth the glory of heaven, but the temper and disposition of
the Jewish church, who were partakers of the external blessings
of the covenant of grace, and the gospel-church, as having
equal privileges; so that the arguments generally insisted on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>to prove that there are no degrees of glory in heaven, can hardly
be reckoned sufficient to overthrow the contrary doctrine;
especially if those other scriptures, that are often brought to
prove that there are, be understood in the most obvious sense
thereof; and they are such as these, <i>viz.</i> Daniel xii. 3. <i>They
that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and
they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever</i>; where the prophet speaks of those who excel in grace
and usefulness in this world; and then considers them not only
as <i>wise</i>, but as <i>turning many to righteousness</i>; whose glory,
after the resurrection, of which he speaks in the foregoing
verse, has something illustrious and distinguishing in it, which
is compared to the <i>brightness of the firmament and stars</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it is objected, that our Saviour, in Matt. xiii. 43. illustrates
the happiness of all the glorified saints, whom he calls
<i>the righteous</i>, by their <i>shining as the sun</i>; therefore the prophet
Daniel means no other glory but what is common to all
saints; and consequently there are no degrees of glory. But to
this it may be replied, that our Saviour does not compare the
glory of one of the saints in heaven, with that of another; but
intimates, that the happiness of every one of them shall be inconceivably
great, and very fitly illustrates it by the <i>brightness
of the sun</i>; whereas the prophet is speaking of some that were
honoured above others in their usefulness here; and then considers
them as having peculiar degrees of glory conferred upon
them hereafter, which is something more than what he had
said in the foregoing verse, which is common to all the saints,
when he speaks of them as <i>awaking out of the dust to everlasting
life</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another scripture which is also brought to prove this doctrine,
is in 1 Cor. xv. 41, 42. <i>There is one glory of the sun,
and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars;
for one star differeth from another star in glory; so also is the
resurrection of the dead</i>; where the apostle is speaking concerning
the happiness of the saints after the resurrection, whom
he compares not with what they were when they left the world;
for then had no glory, being <i>sown in corruption and dishonour</i>;
but he seems to compare the glory of one saint, after the resurrection,
with that of another; and accordingly he illustrates
it by the brightness of the heavenly luminaries; every one of
which has a glory superior to terrestrial bodies: nevertheless he
seems to intimate, that if we compare them together, the glory
of the one exceeds that of the other. Thus the glory of the
least saint in heaven, is inconceivably greater than that of the
greatest here on earth: it is, indeed, full and complete in its
kind; yet when compared with the glory of others, it may in
some circumstances fall short of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>There is another argument brought by some, to prove this
doctrine, taken from the parable of the <i>talents</i>, in Matt. xxv.
14, <i>&amp; seq.</i> in which the reward is proportioned to the respective
improvement thereof; which seems to respect some blessings
which they were to receive in another world; inasmuch as
our Saviour compares himself to one that is <i>travelling into a
far country</i>, and after a long time, returning and reckoning with
his servants: by the former of which is meant, his ascension
into heaven; and by the latter, his return to judgment; and
consequently those regards which differ in degree, must respect
some peculiar glory, which he will confer on his people in another
world; and, indeed, the whole chapter seems to refer to
the same thing. The former parable of the <i>wise</i> and <i>foolish
virgins</i> denotes the behaviour of persons here, and the consequence
thereof hereafter: and the latter part of the chapter expressly
speaks of Christ’s coming to judgment, and dealing with
every one according to his works. If therefore the improvement
of these talents respects some advantages that one is to
expect above the other, it seems to intimate that there are degrees
of glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this is farther argued from those various degrees
of grace that some have in this world above others, which is a
peculiar honour bestowed on them, and is sometimes considered
as the fruit and consequence of their right improvement
of those graces which they had before received. And this may
be considered as laying a foundation for greater praise; which
argues that the soul shall be enlarged in proportion thereunto;
so that it may give unto God the glory due to his name, as the
result thereof. Therefore if we take an estimate of God’s future,
from his present dispensations, it not only removes some
objections that are sometimes brought against this doctrine;
but adds farther strength to those arguments taken from the
scriptures before-mentioned, to prove it. But notwithstanding
all that has been said, on this subject, it is the safest way for
us to confess, that we know but little of the affairs of another
world, and much less of the circumstances of glorified saints,
considered as compared with one another. Nor are we to conclude,
if there are degrees of glory, that the highest degree
thereof is founded on the merit of what any have done or suffered
for Christ; or, on the other hand, that the lowest is inconsistent
with complete blessedness; which shall be proportioned
to their most enlarged desires, and as much as they are
capable of containing. Thus concerning the question proposed
by some, <i>viz.</i> Whether there are degrees of glory?</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another which has some affinity with it, that I would
not wholly pass over; namely, whether the saints in heaven
shall not have some additional improvements, or make progressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>advances in some things, which may be reckoned a farther
ingredient in their future happiness? This is to be insisted on
with the utmost caution, lest any thing should be advanced
which is inconsistent with the complete blessedness, which they
are immediately possessed of: however, I do not think that it
will detract from it, if we should venture to assert, that the
understanding of glorified saints shall receive very considerable
improvements, from those objects which shall be presented
to them, and the perpetual discoveries that will be made of the
glorious mysteries of divine grace, whereby the whole scene of
providence, and its subserviency to their eternal happiness,
shall be opened, to raise their wonder, and enhance their praise.
Since it is not inconsistent with the perfect blessedness of the
angels, to desire to know more of this mystery, which they are
said to <i>look into</i>, 1 Pet. i. 12. and inasmuch as their joy is increased
by those new occasions, which daily present themselves;
why may not the same be said with respect to the saints
in heaven; especially if we consider that this will redound so
much to the glory of God, as well as give us more raised ideas
of that happiness which they shall be possessed of.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall conclude with some practical inferences from what
has been said in this answer, concerning the happiness of the
saints in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We may learn from hence the great difference which
there is between the militant and triumphant state of the church.
Here they meet with perpetual conflicts, but hereafter they shall
be crowned with complete victory: now they walk by faith, but
then faith shall be swallowed up in vision, and hope in enjoyment.
The saints of God are, at present, in their minority, having
a right to, but not the possession of their inheritance. Their
desires are enlarged, and their expectations raised; but nothing
can give them full satisfaction till they arrive to that state of
perfection, which God will, at last, bring them to.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The account which we have of the happiness of heaven,
as being of a spiritual nature, and accompanied with perfect
blessedness, and the enjoyments thereof being agreeable thereto;
this may tend to reprove the carnal conceptions which many
entertain concerning it, as though it were no other than what
Mahomet promised his followers; who fancy that they shall
have therein, those delights, which are agreeable to the sensual
appetites of such as have no other ideas of happiness, but those
which consist in the pleasures of sin: neither is it enough for
us to conceive of it, as barely a freedom from the miseries of
this life (though this be an ingredient therein) as if it had no
reference to the bringing those graces which are begun here,
to perfection; or it did not consist in that blessed work of admiring
and adoring the divine perfections, and improving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>displays thereof in a Mediator, which the saints shall for ever
be engaged in.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Let us not content ourselves barely with the description
which we have in the word of God, concerning the glory
of heaven, but enquire, whether we have a well-grounded hope,
that we have a right to it, and are found in the exercise of those
graces which will be an evidence thereof? It is a very low and
insignificant thing for us to be convinced that the glory of heaven
contains in it all those things which shall render them who
are possessed of it, completely happy, if we have no ground to
claim an interest in it; and if we have this ground of hope, it
will have a tendency to excite practical godliness, which it is
inseparably connected with, and affords an evidence of our right
to eternal life: whereas, without this, our hope will be delusive,
and we chargeable with an unwarrantable presumption, in expecting
salvation without sanctification.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) If we have any hope concerning this future blessedness;
this ought to be improved by us, to support and comfort us under
the present miseries of life; as the apostle exhorts the
church to which he writes, to <i>comfort one another with these
words</i>, 1 Thess. iv. 18. or from these considerations; which
should also be an inducement to us to bear <i>affliction</i> with patience,
since they <i>work for us an exceeding and eternal weight
of glory</i>, 2 Cor. iv. 17. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Let the hope we have of the privileges to be enjoyed
hereafter, put us upon the greatest diligence in the performance
of those duties, which are incumbent on us, as expectants of
this inheritance; and let us endeavour to have our conversation
in heaven, and be frequently meditating on the blessed employment
thereof; and be earnest with God, that we may be
made more meet for, and in the end received to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) If we are enabled, by faith, to conclude that we have a
right to the heavenly inheritance, let us be frequently engaged
in the work and employment thereof, so far as is consistent
with this present imperfect state; let us be much in praising
and blessing God, who has prepared these glorious mansions
for his people; and let us set a due value on the blood of Christ,
by which they were purchased; and give glory to the Holy
Ghost, who has given us the earnest thereof; and having begun
the work of grace, will, we trust, carry it on to perfection.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. XCI., XCII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCI.</span> <i>What is the duty that God requireth of man?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duty which God requireth of man, is, obedience
to his revealed will.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCII.</span> <i>What did God at first reveal unto man as the
rule of his obedience?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the estate
of innocency, and to all mankind in him, beside a special
command, not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, was, the moral law.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having, in the former part of the Catechism, been led
to consider what we are to believe concerning God, and
those works of nature and grace, wherein he has displayed his
glory to man, whether considered as created after his image,
or having lost it by sin, and afterwards redeemed, and made
partaker of those blessings that are consequent thereupon; we
are now to consider him as under an indispensable obligation
to yield obedience to God. They who have received most
grace from him, are laid under the strongest ties and engagements
hereunto; accordingly we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That, obedience is due from man to God. This results
from the relation we stand in to him as creatures;<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c013'><sup>[196]</sup></a> who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>ought to say with the Psalmist, <i>O come let us worship and bow
down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker</i>, Psal. xcv. 6. and
particularly when considered as intelligent creatures, having
excellencies superior to all others in this lower world, whereby
we are rendered capable, not only of subserving the ends of
his providence, but performing obedience, as subjects of moral
government: But if we are redeemed, justified, and sanctified,
and made partakers of all the blessings that accompany
salvation; this obligation to duty, is greater than that of all
others, as the apostle says, <i>Ye are bought with a price; therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
God’s</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 2. And this may be considered, not only as
our duty, but our highest wisdom; as it is said, <i>The fear of the
Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil, is understanding</i>,
Job xxviii. 28. hereby, in some measure, we answer the end
for which we came into the world. And it is our interest, inasmuch
as it is conducive to, and inseparably connected with
our present and future blessedness: Nevertheless we are to be
very sensible that this is out of our own power, as our Saviour
says, <i>Without me ye can do nothing</i>, John xv. 5. Therefore we
should exercise a constant dependence on him, who works in
his people both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.
We might here consider the nature and properties of that duty
and obedience which we owe to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If it be such as we hope God will accept or approve of,
it must proceed from a renewed nature, and as a consequence
thereof, from a principle of love to God, as a reconciled Father;
not from a slavish fear and dread of his wrath, as a sin-revenging
Judge. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>There is forgiveness with
thee, that thou mayest be feared</i>, Psal. cxxx. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It ought to be without the least reserve, as containing a
ready compliance with whatever he commands; and hereby we
ought to approve ourselves to him, as our sovereign Lord and
Law-giver, and consider that we are under his all-seeing eye;
and accordingly his glory is to be assigned as the highest end
of all we do.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It ought to be performed with constancy; and therefore
it doth not consist barely in a sudden fit of devotion, arising
from the dictates of an awakened conscience, or the dread we
have of his wrath, when under some distressing providence;
but it ought to be the constant work and business of life. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When we have done or suffered most for God, we are not
only to consider ourselves as <i>unprofitable servants</i>, Luke xvii.
10. as our Saviour expresses it; but we must lament our imperfections,
and be deeply humbled for the iniquities that attend
our holy things; inasmuch as <i>there is not a just man upon
earth that doth good, and sinneth not</i>, Eccles. vii. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. In order to our yielding obedience, it is necessary that
God should signify to us, in what instances he will be obeyed,
and the manner how it is to be performed; otherwise it would
rather be a fulfilling our own will than his. None but those
who are authorized hereto, and receive what they impart to us
by divine inspiration, can, without the boldest presumption,
assume this prerogative to themselves, so as to prescribe to us
a rule of duty to God; and therefore it follows, that this obedience
must be to his revealed will. The secret purposes of God
are the rule and measure of his own actings; but his revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>will is the rule of our obedience. <i>Secret things belong unto the
Lord our God; but those things which are revealed, belong unto
us and to our children</i>, Deut. xxix. 29.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The will of God, as thus made known to us, is called a
Law: Which, that we may farther understand, let us consider,
that a law is the decree or revealed will of a sovereign, designed
to direct and govern the actions of his subjects, and thereby
to secure his own honour and their welfare. And if this
be applied to the law of God, we must consider him as our
Lord and Sovereign, whose will is the rule of our actions; and
he being infinitely wise and good, is able and inclined to direct
us in those things that are conducive to his own honour and
our safety and happiness; and this he has been pleased to do,
and accordingly has given us a law as the rule of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laws of God are either such as take their rise from his
holy nature, and accordingly our obligation to yield obedience
thereto, proceeds not only or principally from the command of
God, but from their being agreeable to his divine perfections,
which must be assigned as the reason of his prescribing them
as matter of duty. These are all reducible to what we call, in
general, the law of nature; which, because it is agreeable to the
dictates of reason, it is called, by way of eminency, <i>The moral
law</i>. Thus when we consider ourselves as creatures, we are
led to confess that we are subject to God, and therefore bound
to obey him; and when we think of him as a God of infinite
perfection, this obedience must be agreeable thereunto; and because
he is a Spirit, it must be performed in a spiritual manner;
and as he is a holy God, he is to be worshipped with reverence
and holy fear. Thus far we are induced to yield obedience
by the law of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, there are many laws relating to the
circumstances or manner in which God will be worshipped,
which are founded in his sovereign will; and these we call
positive laws. Of this kind was that law given to our first
parents, not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil;
and, doubtless, there were many other laws given to them relating
to their conduct of life, and mode of worship, though
they are not particularly mentioned in that short history we
have of the state of man before the fall. As for the moral law,
it is said, in one of the answers we are explaining, to have been
revealed to Adam in his state of innocency, and to all mankind
in him. Its being revealed to man, must be supposed to
be a less proper way of speaking; inasmuch as that method of
discovery is more especially applicable to positive laws; and
therefore I would rather chuse to express it as it is in a foregoing
answer<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c013'><sup>[197]</sup></a>, by God’s writing his laws in the hearts of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>first parents, or impressing the commands of the moral law on
their nature; so that by the power of reasoning, with which
they were endowed, they might attain to the knowledge thereof.
So that man, by the light of nature, knew all things contained
in the moral law.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is farther said in this answer, that the moral law
was given to man in innocency; that has been considered elsewhere.
And as all mankind were represented by him, so we
are to understand those words, that it was given to all mankind
in him. But these things have been insisted on in another
place, as also what relates to his being prohibited from eating
the tree of knowledge of good and evil, I shall pass it over,
and proceed to speak more particularly concerning the moral
law, together with the use thereof to all sorts of men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. XCIII., XCIV., XCV., XCVI., XCVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCIII.</span> <i>What is the moral law?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The moral law is the declaration of the will of God
to mankind, directing and binding every one to personal,
perfect, and perpetual conformity and obedience thereunto,
in the frame and disposition of the whole man, soul and body,
and in performance of all those duties of holiness and righteousness
which he oweth to God and man; promising life
upon the fulfilling, and threatening death upon the breach of
it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCIV.</span> <i>Is there any use of the moral law to man,
since the fall?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Although no man, since the fall, can attain to righteousness
and life by the moral law; yet there is great use
thereof, as well common to all men, as peculiar, either to the
unregenerate, or the regenerate.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCV.</span> <i>Of what use is the moral law to all men?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The moral law is of use to all men, to inform them of
the holy nature and will of God, and of their duty, binding
them to walk accordingly; to convince them of their disability
to keep it, and of the sinful pollution of their nature,
hearts, and lives; to humble them in a sense of their sin
and misery, and thereby help them to a clearer sight of the
need they have of Christ, and of the perfection of his obedience.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span><span class='sc'>Quest. XCVI.</span> <i>What particular use is there of the moral law
to unregenerate men?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken
their consciences to fly from wrath to come, and to drive
them to Christ; or, upon their continuance in the estate and
way of sin, to leave them inexcusable, and under the curse
thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCVII.</span> <i>What special use is there of the moral law
to the regenerate?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Although they that are regenerate, and believe in
Christ, be delivered from the moral law as a covenant of
works, so as thereby they are neither justified, nor condemned;
yet beside the general uses thereof common to them
with all men, it is of special use to shew them how much
they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling it, and enduring
the curse thereof in their stead, and for their good; and thereby
to provoke them to more thankfulness, and to express the
same in their greater care, to conform themselves thereunto,
as the rule of their obedience.</p>

<p class='c012'>In these answers we have,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. A description of the moral law, in which we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That it is a declaration of the will of God to mankind,
that so we may not be destitute of a rule to guide and regulate
our behaviour, both towards God and man. This is the first
idea contained in a law; and there is another, which respects
the obligation which we are laid under hereby, arising from
our being creatures, and consequently subject to God, who, as
the supreme governor, has an undoubted right to demand obedience
from us to every thing that he prescribes and reveals to
us, as a rule for our direction therein. Moreover, that which
God requires of us in this law, is, personal, perfect, and perpetual
conformity and obedience thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It must be personal, as denoting that it is not to be performed
by proxy; so that whatever services we may expect
from men, we must not conclude that they can perform obedience
for us to God, and thereby fulfil the obligation we are
personally laid under. Yea, we may proceed farther, and assert,
that what Christ has performed for us, does not exempt
us from an obligation to yield perfect obedience; though it is
not to be performed by us with the same view with which he
performed it, as will be farther considered under a following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>head, where we shall shew, that though it is not to be obeyed
by us as a covenant of works; nevertheless we are obliged to
obey it as a rule of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Our obedience to the law of God must be perfect. The
same obligation that man was under at first, to yield perfect
obedience, remains still in force, though we are not able to perform
it. The insolvency of man by the fall, did not cancel or
disannul this debt<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c013'><sup>[198]</sup></a>. And how much soever God may own
and approve of the sincerity of his people, which is all the perfection
which fallen man can arrive to in this world; yet we
must not suppose, that hereby we fulfil the obligation which
God, as a law-giver, has laid us under. This I the rather take
notice of, that there may not be the least ground to suppose
that we make void the law, but rather establish it, and thereby
assert the right which God has to that perfection of obedience,
which is due from us, though unable to perform it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It must be perpetual, without backsliding from God, or
the least remissness in our duty to him; and therefore there is
no abatement or dispensation allowed of, that may give countenance
to the least defect of this obedience. Thus the Psalmist
says, <i>I will never forget thy precepts</i>, Psal. cxix. 93. and,
<i>Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever
and ever</i>, Psal. cxlv. 2. Moreover, we may observe, that this
obedience is to be performed with the whole man, and in particular,
by the soul, with the utmost intenseness, in all the powers
and faculties thereof. Accordingly our understandings are
to be rightly instructed, as to what respects the matter and
manner of performing it; our wills to be entirely subjected to
the will of God, and our affections engaged therein, as being
sanctified and excited by the Spirit, to the end, that duty may
be performed with delight, arising from the love which we
bear to him, whose servants we are.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also to be performed with our bodies. The former,
includes in it that obedience more especially which is internal;
this, that which is external. This is what is styled a lower
sort of obedience; and if we rest here, it is so far from being acceptable,
as the apostle says, that <i>Bodily exercise profiteth little</i>,
1 Tim. iv. 8. Nevertheless, as the body is an instrument of the
soul in acting, that service which is performed therein, is absolutely
necessary; and therefore all religious worship is to be
engaged in with a becoming reverence that is external, as well
as that which is internal; without which the soul cannot be
said to engage in any religious duties, in a becoming manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is farther observed, that this obedience includes in it holiness
and righteousness. The former of these respects more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>especially our duty to God, which, being a branch of religious
worship, ought to be performed with a reverential fear of his
divine Majesty, and that due regard to his infinite purity, and
entire dedication and consecration of ourselves to him, as becomes
those who are sanctified by his Spirit, and enabled to
exercise all those graces whereby we may approve ourselves
his faithful servants and subjects. The latter more especially
respects those duties which we owe to men, in the various relations
we stand in to them, which is incumbent on us as what
is enjoined by God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The moral law is farther considered as having a promise
of life annexed to it, and a threatning of death upon the breach
thereof. This is what is generally called the sanction annexed
to the law. A law without a sanction would not be much regarded,
especially by those who have not a due sense of their
obligation to obedience. Persons are very much disposed to
enquire, when a command is given, what the consequences of
their obeying or disregarding it will be? and this being made
known before hand, is a strong motive to obedience. If God
is pleased, out of his abundant grace, to encourage his people,
by giving them to expect some blessings that he will bestow
on those that obey him, it is, in some respect, necessary that
this should be known. But especially since punishment, in proportion
to the nature of the crime, will be the consequence of
disobedience, it is becoming the divine perfections to let it be
known, that the wages of sin is death. And this was not only
annexed to the moral law, but equally impressed on the nature
of man, who could not but know, that rebellion against God
would be punished with a separation from him, and that all
those miseries would attend it, in proportion to the respective
aggravation thereof, that it deserves.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We have an account of the use of the moral law since
the fall; and that either with respect to mankind in general,
or the unregenerate and regenerate. And here it is observed,
that no man since the fall, can attain righteousness and life by
it; therefore it is not to be used with that view. From whence
we may infer, that this might have been attained by man before
the fall, according to the tenor of the covenant which he
was under, the sum and substance whereof was that <i>the man
that doth these things shall live by them</i>, Rom. x. 5. as the apostle
says. Eternal life was promised to man in innocency;
and he was then able to yield sinless obedience, which was the
condition thereof. But it is impossible for fallen man thus to
obey; for how perfect soever his obedience may be for the future,
it is supposed, from the nature of the thing, that it cannot
be sinless, after sin has been committed; and it would be
a reflection on the justice and holiness of God, for us to conclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>that he will accept of imperfect obedience, instead of perfect.
Therefore it follows, that a right to life is not to be
expected from our imperfect obedience to the law, as the apostle
says, <i>By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified</i>,
chap. iii. 20. in God’s sight; in this respect our own righteousness
is represented not only as faulty and defective, but as
altogether insufficient to procure an interest in the divine favour,
or to exempt us from the punishment which is due to us
for sin. It is one thing to say, that eternal life is connected
with obedience, so that no one can have the least ground to
expect it without it; and another thing to say, that it is founded
upon it, or, that it gives us a right and title to it. Nevertheless,
we are not to conclude that the law is of no use; for,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is of use to all men, in several respects:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It informs us of the holy nature and will of God, and
of our duty to him. This is the first idea we have of a law<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c013'><sup>[199]</sup></a>,
which signifies more especially a doctrine; and, as the subject-matter
thereof, respects our being taught what we are obliged
to, as commanded by a law-giver, it signifies a law. The divine
perfections are eminently instamped on it in very legible
characters; his sovereignty, as having a right to demand obedience;
his holiness in the matter thereof, and in the obligation
we are herein laid under to be <i>holy in all conversation; because
it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy</i>, 1 Pet. i. 15, 16.
and therefore this perfection is set forth in those threatnings
that are annexed to it, whereby <i>the wrath of God is revealed
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men</i>, Rom. i. 18.
As it is designed to discover our secret faults, that we may be
humbled for them, and hereby a multitude of sins may be prevented,
so it not only sets forth the holiness, but the goodness
of God; and indeed there is nothing enjoined therein as our
duty, but what includes in it some advantage. Thus the Psalmist
describes it as <i>more to be desired than gold, yea, than
much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honey comb;
and adds, that in keeping thereof, there is great reward</i>, Psal.
xix. 10, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The moral law is of use to all men, as it binds them to
perform that which is therein enjoined as matter of duty, which
is another idea contained in a law, <i>viz.</i> as it is that which binds
the consciences of men, that so we may not vainly and presumptuously
conclude, to our own destruction, that we may
live as we list, or say, who is Lord over us? It is a great instance
of the care and goodness of God, that he has taken this
method to prevent that ruin which would arise from our withdrawing
the allegiance which we owe to him, and lay us under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>the strictest engagement to seek after that blessedness
which is connected with obedience to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are hereby convinced of our inability to keep the
law, and of the sinful pollution of our nature, hearts, and lives,
as an expedient to humble us under the sense of sin and misery.
The law being spiritual, we are thereby convinced that <i>we are
carnal</i>, and <i>sold under sin</i>, as the apostle expresses it, Rom.
vii. 14. And he also says, <i>I had not known sin, but by the
law</i>, ver. 7. When we consider ourselves as being obliged to
yield perfect obedience, and compare our hearts and lives therewith,
we shall see nothing but holiness and purity on the one
hand, and a wretched mass of corruption and impurity on the
other. God demands perfect obedience; and we are unable,
of ourselves, to perform any obedience. And our best duties
being attended with many imperfections, we are hereby led to
be humbled under a sense of sin, whatever thoughts we, before
this, had of ourselves. When <i>the law enters, sin</i> will <i>abound</i>,
chap. v. 20. and if we were apprehensive that we were
alive, as the apostle expresseth it, <i>without the law; when the
commandment comes, sin</i> will <i>revive and we die</i>, chap. vii. 9.
and see ourselves exposed to the miseries threatened to those
that violate it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) From hence arises a clear sight of the need that persons
have of Christ, and of the perfection of his obedience.
When we find ourselves condemned by the law, and that righteousness
is not to be attained by our own obedience to it, then
we are led to see our need of seeking it elsewhere; and when
the gospel gives us a discovery of Christ, as ordained by God,
to procure for us righteousness, or a right to eternal life by his
obedience, this will shew us the need we have of faith in him,
whereby we derive from him that which could not be attained
by our own conformity to the law.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The moral law is of use in particular to the unregenerate.
We have considered, under the former head, that it is
of use to all men (among whom the unregenerate are included)
as it gives them a discovery of the pollution and guilt of sin;
and now we are led to enquire into the consequence hereof.
Sin may be charged on the conscience, and the guilt thereof
make it very uneasy, so that a person may apprehend himself
under the condemning sentence of the law, and yet receive no
saving advantage hereby; he may have a sight of sin, and not
be truly humbled for it or turned from it. In some, corruption
is hereby excited, and the soul grows worse than it was
before; thus the apostle says, <i>sin taking occasion by the commandment,
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence</i>, ver. 8.
Others, when filled with a dread of the wrath of God, are inclined
to stretch out their hand against him, and strengthen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>themselves against the Almighty; resolving, some way or
other, to disentangle themselves, though they render their condition
much worse thereby. These are compared to <i>a wild
bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord</i>, Isa. li. 20. or, as our
Saviour says concerning Paul, before his conversion, <i>they kick
against the pricks</i>, Acts ix. 5. Every step they take to free
themselves from the horrible pit and miry clay, into which
they are cast, sinks them deeper into it. Others are convinced
of sin by the law, and, at the same time, despair of obtaining
mercy; they complain with Cain, <i>My punishment is greater
than I can bear</i>, Gen. iv. 13. or, as it is in the margin, <i>Mine
iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven.</i> These see
themselves lost, or condemned by the law, but have no sight
of Christ as coming into the world to save sinners, or, at least,
the chief of them. The wound is opened, but there are no healing
medicines applied. But there are others whose condition
is no less dangerous, in whom the <i>wound is healed slightly</i>,
who <i>say, Peace, peace, when there is no peace</i>, Jer. vi. 14.
They are indeed, convinced of sin, and this is attended sometimes
with an external humiliation, arising from the dread of
God’s judgments. This effect it had in Pharaoh, Exod. x. 16,
17. and Ahab, 1 Kings xxi. 27-29. and they are willing to
part with some particular sins, while they indulge others, that
by this partial reformation they may free themselves from the
condemning sentence of the law; but all this is to no purpose,
sin gains strength hereby, and the guilt thereof is still increased.
This is a wrong method taken to flee from the wrath to
come; and therefore, when these convictions of sin have a good
issue, in flying from it, they have recourse to Christ. This is
called a being driven to Christ; by which we are to understand
that they see themselves under an unavoidable necessity of going
to him, as not being able to find peace or solid rest elsewhere.
But since this effect is, in a peculiar manner, ascribed
to the gospel, the law being only the remote means hereof, I
would rather express it by their being drawn to him, or encouraged
by the grace contained therein, to close with him by
faith; and then the work is rendered effectual, and convictions
end in a saving conversion. But if it be otherwise, or they
apply themselves to indirect means, to ease themselves of the
burden that lies on them, they are farther described as left inexcusable,
and still remaining under the curse and condemning
sentence of the law.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The moral law is of use to the regenerate. In considering
which it may be observed; that there is something supposed
in the answer, which treats on this subject, namely, that
they who believe in Christ are delivered from it as a covenant
of works; which is the only sense in which we are to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>those scriptures, which speak of believers as <i>not</i> being
<i>under the law</i>, Rom. vi. 14. and being <i>dead to the law</i>, chap.
vii. 4. as <i>being redeemed from the curse thereof</i>, Gal. iii. 13.
The moral law is to be considered in two respects, as a rule
of life, and so no one is delivered from it; or else, as a covenant
of works, in the same sense in which it was given to man
in innocency, the condition of which was his performing perfect
obedience, in default whereof he was liable to a sentence
of death. In this latter respect a believer is delivered from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the great privilege that such are made partakers of
in the gospel; which sets forth Christ as our Surety, performing
perfect obedience for us, and enduring the curse we were
liable to; so that though it was a covenant of works to him, it
ceases to be so to them who are interested in him; and accordingly
it is farther added, that they are hereby neither justified
nor condemned. Not justified; thus the apostle says, <i>By the
deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified</i>, Rom. iii. 20. This
is therefore only to be expected from him who is <i>the Lord our
righteousness</i>, Jer. xxiii. 6. <i>in whom all the seed of Israel shall
be justified, and glory</i>, Isa. xlv. 25. Nor are they condemned
by the law; for that is inconsistent with a justified state; as
the apostle says, <i>There is no condemnation to them which are
in Christ Jesus</i>, Rom. viii. 1. However, we must distinguish
between a believer’s actions being condemned by the law, or
his being reproved thereby, and laid under conviction, for sins
daily committed; and his being in a condemned state, according
to the sentence thereof. We are far from denying that a
believer is under an obligation to condemn or abhor himself,
that is, to confess that he deserves to be condemned, by God,
for the sins that he commits, which, if he should mark, or punish
him according to the demerit of, he could not stand. Thus
the Psalmist says, though speaking of himself as a believer,
and consequently in a justified state, <i>Enter not into judgment
with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified</i>,
Psal. cxliii. 2. This a believer may say, and yet not conclude
himself to be in a state of condemnation; inasmuch as
he sees himself, by faith, to have ground to determine that he
is delivered from, and so not condemned by the law, as a covenant
of works.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is observed, on the other hand, in the answer
under our present consideration, that the moral law is of use
to a believer, in those respects in which it is of use to all men;
and therefore he is laid under the strictest obligation to perform
all the duties which we owe to God and man, and to be
humbled for those defects which he has reason to charge himself
with, which call for the daily exercise of repentance towards
God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>But as to the special use of the moral law to those who
are regenerate, as distinguished from all others, it is said to
shew them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling
it, and enduring the curse thereof in their stead, and for
their good. Thus <i>Christ is</i> said to be <i>the end of the law for
righteousness</i>, Rom. x. 4. that is, he has answered the end and
demand of the law, by performing that obedience which it requires,
and thereby procuring a justifying righteousness, which
is applied to every one that believes. This lays them under a
superadded obligation to obedience, peculiar to them as believers;
so that they are not only engaged to the practice of
universal holiness, from the consideration of the sovereignty
of God commanding in common with all others, but from <i>the
love of Christ</i>, which does as it were <i>constrain them</i> hereunto,
2 Cor. v. 14. And hereby they are said to be provoked to
more thankfulness, as they have greater inducements hereunto
than any others; and this gratitude cannot be better expressed
than by the utmost care to approve themselves to him in all
things. Therefore the grace of God is so far from leading to
licentiousness, that all who have experienced it, are hereby
put upon the exercise of that obedience which they owe to God
as their rightful Lord and Sovereign, and to Christ as their
gracious Redeemer, whom they love entirely; and therefore
keep his commandments.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot but here take occasion to observe, not only with
dislike, but a just indignation, how some, under a pretence of
religion, sap the very foundation of it, while they frequently
make mention of the gospel, and the liberty wherewith Christ
has made his people free, and at the same time abuse it, not
only by practising, but pleading for licentiousness. The Epicureans
were libertines among the Heathen, and the Sadducees
among the Jews; but these were vile and profligate out of
principle; either denying the being of a God, or disowning
his perfections as well as future rewards and punishments; and
therefore it is no wonder they had no regard to the divine
law. But I want words to express the wickedness of those
who pervert the gospel of Christ, as though that exempted
them from the obligation which all are under to universal obedience.</p>

<p class='c006'>The apostle had to do with some such in his day; and therefore
he represents them as saying, <i>Is the law sin?</i> that is, since
we are delivered from the condemning sentence thereof, may
we not take encouragement from thence to sin? or, as he elsewhere
brings them in as saying, <i>Shall we continue in sin, that
grace may abound?</i> chap. vi. 1. To both which he replies,
with the greatest detestation, <i>God forbid</i>. After this, in an
early age of the church, the Nicolaitans, Rev. ii. 6. and Gnostics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>and among them, the Valentinians held these pernicious
opinions, and encouraged themselves in the practice of the
greatest immoralities<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c013'><sup>[200]</sup></a>. And Augustin speaks of the Aetians
and Eunomians, who lived in his time, who pretended that
any one who persisted in the vilest crimes, would receive no
detriment thereby, provided they adhered to the sentiments
which they advanced<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c013'><sup>[201]</sup></a>. And there are many, in later ages,
whose sentiments have been, in this respect, subversive of all
religion; and from their denying the obligation we are under,
to yield obedience to the law of God, are justly called Antinomians.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, that we may not appear to be unjust to the characters
of men, let it be considered, that we are not here speaking
of the charge of Antinomianism, which some, who defend
or oppose the doctrines of grace, bring against each other; as
supposing that their respective sentiments lead to licentiousness.
The Papists and Pelagians pretend, though unjustly,
that the doctrine of predestination, efficacious grace, and the
final perseverance of the saints, is liable to this charge; while
they on the other hand, lay themselves open to the like charge,
by advancing doctrines which have the most pernicious tendency,
as subversive of practical godliness, in various instances;
particularly their asserting, that God in the gospel-covenant,
dispenses with imperfect obedience instead of perfect; and
this is no other than what we are able to perform without the
aids of divine grace. But this we pass over, leaving each party
to defend their scheme from this imputation.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to others, who are more especially known by the character
of Antinomians, these are of two sorts, namely, such
who openly maintain that the moral law is not a rule of life in
any sense; and that good works are not to be insisted on as
having any reference to salvation; and therefore, if persons
presume, as they, according to them, ought to do, that Christ
died for them, and they were justified before they had a being,
they may live in the practice of the greatest immoralities, or
give countenance to them that do so, without entertaining the
least doubt of their salvation; and that it is a preposterous
thing for those who thus presumptuously conclude themselves
to be justified, to confess themselves guilty of sin; since that
would be to deny that they are in a justified state, or in any
sense, to pray for the pardon thereof; since that would argue
that it is not forgiven. Neither can they, with any tolerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>degree of patience, entertain the least exhortations to practical
godliness; because they pretend, that they are exempted from
the obligation to perform any branch thereof, by their not being
under the law. Nay, some of them have been so impudent,
and daringly wicked, as to assert, that if they should commit
murder, adultery, or any other crimes of the like nature, even
this would be no bar in the way of their salvation; nor the
most vile sins that can be committed, do them any hurt, or in
the least affect their eternal state. I have, indeed, sometimes
thought that this representation of Antinomianism was no other
than a consequence, deduced from some absurd doctrines that
have been maintained; or that so much of hell could never put
on the mask or shew of religion in any degree; and that this
character belonged to none but those who are open and professed
Atheists. But though my lot has not been cast among
persons of so vile a character, yet I have been informed, by
those whose souls have been grieved with such conversation,
that there are some in the world who thus set themselves
against the law of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are others, indeed, who are styled Antinomians,
whose conversation is blameless, and are not therefore to be
ranked with these men, or judged Antinomians in practice;
who, nevertheless, do great disservice to the truth; and, it may
be, give occasion to some to be licentious, by advancing unguarded
expressions, which will admit of a double construction,
without condescending to explain some bold positions,
which they occasionally lay down.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus when they maintain eternal justification, without considering
it as an immanent act in God, or as his secret determination,
not to impute sin to those who are given to Christ;
but ascribe that to it, which is only to be applied to justification,
as it is the result of God’s revealed will, in which respect
it is said to be by faith: and when they encourage persons
from hence, to conclude that their state is safe; and to maintain
that it is the duty of every one to believe that he is thus
justified; this has certainly a tendency to lead some out of the
way of truth and holiness, whether they design it or no. And
when others speak diminutively of good works as though they
were in no sense necessary to salvation, because they are not
the matter of our justification. This may give occasion to
some to think that they may be saved without them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when others deny the law to be a rule of life, or assert
that believers have nothing to do with it; though, it may be,
they understand nothing else by it, but that it is not that rule,
according to which God proceeds in justifying, or giving his
people a right to eternal life; or, that a believer is not under
the law, as a covenant of works; yet many would be ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>think the words had a different meaning, and so be led out of
the way thereby, how far soever this might be from their intention.
And if a person seems studiously to avoid confessing
of sin, or praying for forgiveness, some would be ready to
judge of his sentiments by his practice; and certainly our denying
this to be a duty in any sense, is not only contrary to
scripture, but inconsistent with that humility and faith which
are essential to practical godliness. Or when persons deny that
self-examination is a duty; and speak of all marks and evidences
of grace, though never so just and agreeable to the
scripture-account thereof, as legal, or a low way, in order to a
person’s coming to the knowledge of himself; or suppose that
they are unnecessary, as being inconsistent with the Spirit’s
testimony: This has a tendency to lead to presumption, which
is a degree of licentiousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, when they assert that God is not angry with his
people for their sins, nor, in any sense, punishes them for them,
without distinguishing between fatherly chastisements, and the
stroke of vindictive justice, or the external and sensible effects
of that hatred which God cannot but exercise against sin, and
his casting them out of a justified state: Such doctrines as
these lead some persons to licentiousness, whatever be the
secret meaning of those that advance them.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have an instance of this, as the historian observes<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c013'><sup>[202]</sup></a>, in
Agricola, who was Luther’s towns-man, and great admirer;
who, as it is probable, did not thoroughly understand what he
maintained concerning the subserviency of the law to the gospel,
and its having no place in the justification of a sinner; or
else, from some unguarded expressions, which he was sometimes
apt to make use of; this friend of his took occasion to
advance some Antinomian tenets, <i>viz.</i> that repentance ought
not to be urged from the consideration of the breach of the
law; and that the gospel ought to be preached to sinners before
they are brought under conviction by the law; and that
how scandalous and debauched soever persons be in their
lives, yet, if they do but believe the promises of the gospel,
they shall be justified. In this, Agricola was followed by a
party of men; and accordingly Antinomianism is said to have
taken its rise, in this part of the world, from that time. Luther,
on the other hand, was forced to take a great deal of pains to
rectify his mistakes; which, though it tended to his conviction,
yet it did not put a stop to the spread of his errors, which he
had before propagated.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those who were charged with Antinomianism in
England, in the last century, such as Dr. Crisp, Eaton, Saltmarsh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Town, and others, whatever their design might be, and
how much soever they were remote from the charge of Antinomianism
in practice; though it be alleged in their vindication,
by some, that the principal thing they had in view, was
to bear their testimony against the prevailing doctrine of Arminianism,
that was studiously propagated by some persons of
great character and influence in the nation: Nevertheless, we
cannot but conclude, that they had done more service to the
cause of truth, had they been more cautious in explaining their
sentiments, and saved those, who had favourable thoughts of
them in other respects, the trouble of producing some expressions
out of their writings, to convince the world that they did
not hold those dangerous notions which were charged upon
them: and it is too evident to be denied, that many have
taken them in the worst sense; who have from hence been
ready to charge the most important doctrines of the gospel, as
leading to licentiousness, and this has made some more sparing
in defending those truths which ought to have been insisted
on, and explained, though in other words more intelligible
and unexceptionable.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. XCVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> XCVIII. <i>Where is the moral law summarily comprehended?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The moral law is summarily comprehended in the
Ten commandments, which were delivered by the voice of
God upon mount Sinai, and written by him in two tables of
stone, and are recorded in the twentieth chapter of Exodus;
the four first Commandments containing our duty to God,
and the other six our duty to man.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having considered the moral law, as written on the
heart of man at first, and the knowledge thereof, in some
degree attainable by all who exercise their reasoning powers:
We are in this, and some following answers, led to consider
that epitome, or abstract thereof, that was given to the Israelites
by the voice of God upon mount Sinai, which is contained in
the Ten Commandments.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since we are considering this instance of divine condescension
to them, it may not be reckoned altogether foreign to
our present design, for us to give some brief account of those
other laws which God gave, together with the moral law;
most of which were communicated from mount Sinai: And
therefore we may observe, that together with the moral law,
there were several forensic or judicial laws given by God for
the government of the people of Israel, which more especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>respected their civil rights. And there were other laws which
had a more immediate subserviency to their attaining the
knowledge of those things which related to the way of salvation
by the promised Messiah, which are more fully revealed
in the gospel: And this is what we call the ceremonial law.
Both these are to be considered before we come to speak concerning
the moral law, as summarily comprehended in the
Ten Commandments.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the judicial law. It cannot be supposed that
so great a people, so much interested in the care of God, to
whom he condescended to be their king, should be without a
body of laws for their government: Accordingly there were
some given them by him, which were founded in, and agreeable
to the law of nature and nations; which all well-governed
states observe unto this day, viz. that murder should be punished
with death; theft with restitution, or some other punishment
that may best tend to deter from it. Moreover, besides
these, there were other judicial laws given to Israel, which had
a more immediate tendency to promote their civil welfare, as
a nation distinguished from all others in the world; which
laws expired when their civil policy was extinct. And these
were,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Such as tended to prevent the alienation of inheritances
from the respective families to which they were at first given.
Accordingly God commanded, that if a man died without
children, his brother should marry his widow to raise up seed
to him, to inherit his estate and name, Deut. xxv. 5, 6. Matt,
xxii. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If an Israelite was waxen poor, and obliged to sell his
land, for the payment of his debts; the purchaser was to admit
any of his family to redeem it; or, if they could not, he
was, nevertheless, to restore the land at the <i>year of Jubilee</i>,
which was every <i>fiftieth</i> year, Levit. xxv. 11, 12, 13, 25,
26, 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If an Hebrew servant was sold for the payment of debts,
which he could not otherwise discharge; his master was obliged
to release him after six years service, Exod. xxi. 2. But if
the servant chose to stay with his master longer than that time,
out of the love he bore to him; then he was to have his ear
bored, as a token that he should serve him, without being subject
to the aforesaid laws, which made provision for his discharge
after a certain number of years, ver. 5, 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The land was to lie untilled, and the vine-yards and olive-yards
were to be free for every one to come and eat of the
fruit thereof every <i>seventh</i> year; designed more especially for
the relief of the poor, amongst them, who had no distinct inheritance
of their own, chap. xxiii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>5. They were prohibited from taking usury of an Israelite,
though they might of a stranger. The reason of which law
might be, either that they might exercise brotherly kindness
and charity to one another, in which sense the law is in force
to this day; especially when the poor borrow money to supply
themselves with necessary food, in which case it is now unlawful
to take usury. Or else it is to be considered, that the
Israelites lived upon their farms or cattle, by which they seldom
got more than what was a necessary provision for their
families. And therefore the paying usury whenever they were
necessitated to borrow money, would have procured their ruin
in the end. Therefore they were not to take usury of an Israelite,
but of a stranger they might; because they enriched
themselves by merchandise, and were gainers in a way of
trade, by what they borrowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. All the males were to come up to Jerusalem, to appear
before God, and perform public worship in the temple three
times a year, viz. at the solemn festivals; the passover, pentecost,
and the feast of tabernacles, Deut. xvi. 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Six cities of refuge were appointed for those to fly to, for
protection, who killed any one by accident. Though a near
kinsman, as an avenger of blood might kill the man-slayer before
he came to one of these cities. The design of which law
was to induce them to take care that none might lose their
lives through inadvertency. And there was provision made in
these cities for the man-slayer to dwell safely; whereby a just
difference was put between such an one, and a wilful murderer,
Numb. xxxv. 15, 26, 27. Thus concerning the judicial laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We now proceed to consider the ceremonial laws that
were given them, the end whereof was to lead them into the
knowledge of Christ, and the way of salvation by him, then
to come, Heb. x. 1. Gal. iii. 24, 25. These may be considered
under six heads, which we shall speak briefly to;</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] It was ordained, that all their males should be circumcised.
This was designed to be a visible mark put on the
church, whom God had set apart for himself, that hereby they
might be distinguished from the world: But the principal design
hereof was, that it might be a sign or seal of the blessings
of the covenant of grace, in which God promised that he
would be <i>a God to them</i>; and they were hereby to own themselves
as his people, Gen. xvii. 7, 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] There were various ways whereby persons were reckoned
unclean, and ordinances appointed for their cleansing.
They were rendered unclean, by eating those birds, beasts,
fishes, and creeping things, which God had pronounced unclean,
and not designed for food, Lev. xi. Moreover, they
were polluted by touching the dead bodies of such unclean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>birds, beasts, fishes, or creeping things, ver. 31. Again, some
diseases, incident to the bodies of men, which were more than
ordinarily noisome, rendered them unclean, as the issue, leprosy,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Lev. xv. 2, <i>&amp; seq.</i> and ch. xiii. and the clothes
they wore, the houses they lived in, the beds on which they
lay, their ovens and the vessels used in eating or drinking,
were, on several accounts, deemed unclean, and accordingly
were either to be cleansed or destroyed; otherwise the owners
thereof would be polluted hereby<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c013'><sup>[203]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This law was designed to signify how odious and abominable
sin, which is a moral pollution, is, in God’s account, who
is <i>of purer eyes than to behold iniquity</i>, Hab. i. 13. We might
also observe; that there are various ordinances appointed for
their cleansing, in order to which, several sacrifices were to be
offered, and divers washings with water, Lev. xiii—15. The
former of these signified the way of our being delivered from
sin by the blood of Christ, as the procuring cause of forgiveness,
Heb. ix. 13, 14. Eph. i. 7. the latter, our being cleansed
from sin by the internal, powerful influences of the Holy
Spirit, in regeneration and sanctification, Ezek. xxxvi. 25-27.
Heb. x. 22. Tit. iii. 5, 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] There were holy places, such as the tabernacle and
temple, with the vessels and ornaments thereof. The tabernacle
was erected according to the pattern which God shewed to
Moses in the mount, Exod. xxv. 40. and was so framed, that
it might be taken to pieces, and removed from place to place,
as often as the host of Israel changed their station in the wilderness:
And accordingly there were Levites appointed to take
it down and set it up; and also waggons with oxen, to carry
it, excepting those parts of it which belonged to the holiest of
all, which were to be carried on their shoulders, Numb. vii. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>The temple was that fixed place appointed for public worship
at Jerusalem; first built by Solomon, and afterwards rebuilt
by Zerubbabel. And both this and the tabernacle signified,
that God would dwell in the midst of his people, and accept
of that solemn and instituted worship that was to be performed
by his church, in all ages. This was designed to be a type of
the incarnation of the Son of God, who is styled <i>Emmanuel,
God with us</i>; and in allusion hereunto, he calls his body <i>a
temple</i>, John ii. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the courts of this tabernacle and temple, and the
ministry performed therein, had each their respective signification
annexed to them. That, in which the priests came daily
to minister, wherein gifts and sacrifices were offered, prefigured
Christ’s offering himself a sacrifice upon earth, for the sins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>of his people. And the inner court, which was the holiest of
all, into which none but the high-priest was to enter, and that
with blood and incense, signified Christ’s <i>entering into heaven,
to appear in the presence of God for us</i>, Heb. ix. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the vessels of the tabernacle and temple, these were
either such as were in the first court, which is also called <i>the
sanctuary; in which was the candlestick, the table, and the
shew-bread</i>, Lev. xxiv. 2-7. Heb. ix. 2. the laver and the
altar, Exod. xxx. 18. all which were designed for types. The
candlestick signified the church, and the preaching the gospel
therein; whereby light is held forth to the world, Rev. i. 20.
Matt. v. 14. The shew-bread set up, signified the communion
which the members of the church have with Christ, and with
one another, 1 Cor. x. 17. as he styles himself, the <i>bread of
life</i>, or, <i>the bread of God, which cometh down from heaven, and
giveth life unto the world</i>, John vi. 33. The laver signified,
that when we draw nigh to God, our persons and services
ought to be pure and holy; to which the apostle alludes, when
he says, <i>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance
of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
and our bodies washed with pure water</i>, Heb. x. 22. The altar,
which was holy, and sanctified the gift that the high-priest offered
thereon, Matt, xxiii. 19. so that <i>every thing that touched
it was holy</i>, Exod. xxix. 37. this signified, that the divine nature
of Christ added an infinite worth to what he did in the
human; in which he offered himself a sacrifice to God. These
were the vessels in the outer court.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vessels in the inward court, or holiest of all <i>in which
were the golden censer, the ark of the covenant, and the Cherubims
of glory shadowing the mercy seat</i>, Heb. ix. 3-5. were
a symbol and type of God’s special presence with his people,
which is their glory; or of the Son of God’s dwelling with us,
in our nature. The mercy-seat, which was placed over it, signified
that the mercy of God was displayed to sinners, through
Christ. The cherubims of glory with their wings spread, overshadowing
and looking down upon the mercy-seat, signified
that the angels behold and admire the stupendous work of redemption,
1 Pet. i. 12. The altar of incense, and the golden
censer, were types of the intercession of Christ for his people;
and its fragrancy typified the acceptableness thereof in the
sight of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were, besides these, three more things in the holiest
of all, which are particularly mentioned, viz. the <i>pot of manna</i>,
which was miraculously preserved from corruption throughout
their generations, as a memorial of the bread which God had
fed them with in the wilderness, and a type of Christ, the
bread of life, who was to come down from heaven, John vi.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>48-50. There was also Aaron’s rod, which was preserved
in memory of the wonders that were wrought by it in Egypt,
at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness: And it is said to have
<i>blossomed and yielded almonds</i>, Numb. xvii. 8. which seemed
to typify the flourishing state of the gospel; which is called,
<i>The rod of God’s strength</i>, Psal. cx. 2. Moreover, the two
tables of the law were put into the ark, whereby the exceeding
holiness of it was signified; and also that the law should be
fulfilled and magnified by Christ, when he came to dwell
among us. Thus we have given a brief account of the holy
vessels of the temple and tabernacle.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might also have added, that there were various ornaments
thereof; they were adorned with silver, gold, and precious
stones, carved, and curious needle-work; which rendered
them exceeding rich and beautiful. The temple in particular,
was the wonder of the world, far surpassing all other buildings,
either before or since, Exod. xxv. 3-7. 1 Chron. xxix. 2-5.
And this may be supposed to shadow forth the spiritual beauty
and glory of the gospel-church, and of the heavenly state, in
which it shall be brought to its utmost perfection, Rev. xxi.
11-23. Thus concerning those holy places, which were immediately
designed for worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were other holy places, such as the land of Canaan,
which was styled the <i>Holy land</i>, and the inhabitants thereof a
holy nation, or <i>the people of his holiness</i>, Isa. lxiii. 18. And as
this was a place where God gave them rest, and a settlement,
after forty years travel in the wilderness, it was a type of that
rest which the church was to expect from Christ under the
gospel, Isa. xi. 10. Heb. iv. 9. Moreover, Jerusalem was an
holy city, Nehem. xi. 1. Matt. iv. 5. because thither the tribes
went up to worship, Psal. cxxii. 4. and God was present with
them there, Ezek. xxxvii. 27, 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] There were other laws that respected those whom God
had appointed to be ministers in holy things. These were the
Priests and Levites, who were to assist them in some parts of
their office; but especially the high-priest, who was the chief
or head of them all, who is considered as an eminent type of
Christ’s Priestly office in several respects, Heb. v. 1-5. And
there were various ceremonies instituted, which were observed
in their consecration of them; particularly they were to be
washed with water, Exod. xxix. 4. which was a rite used in
the consecration of persons and things; and signified, that they
who ministred in holy things, should be holy in their conversation.
Moreover, there were several garments to be made and
put on them, which are styled <i>holy</i>, and designed <i>for glory
and for beauty</i>, chap. xxviii. 2, <i>&amp; seq.</i> These signified the
dignity and holiness of Christ’s priesthood. And particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>the breast-plate, which was only worn by the high-priest,
adorned with precious stones, on which the names of the children
of Israel were engraven, with which he was to go into
the holy of holies. This signified the concern of Christ’s people
in the execution of his Priestly office, and his representing
them when appearing in the presence of God for them. Again,
they were anointed with the precious ointment, compounded
for that purpose, chap. xxx. 25, 30. whereby they were set
apart, or consecrated to minister in the priest’s office, and were
types of Christ; upon which account he is said to be <i>anointed
with the oil of gladness above his fellows</i>, Psal. xlv. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] There were other laws respecting the temple-service,
or the gifts and sacrifices that were to be offered there. There
were many gifts presented or devoted to God; some of which
were not designed for sacrifice, but to testify their acknowledgment
of God’s right to all we are and have; and among
these, the first ripe fruits were offered, or presented, as gifts
to him, Exod. xxix. 29. As for those things that were designed
for sacrifice, these were offered, and their blood poured
forth on the altar; which signified the expiation of sin by the
blood of Jesus, Heb. ix. 22, 23, 26. And that part of the
high-priest’s office, which respected his carrying the blood with
the incense, into the holiest of all, was a type of Christ’s <i>entering
into heaven, there to appear in the presence of God</i> for
his people, chap. ix. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] There were other laws that respected the holy times or
festivals, appointed for solemn worship. Some of these were
monthly, as the new moons; others annual, as the passover;
which was not only a sign memorizing their having been
formerly delivered from the sword of the destroying angel,
when he slew the first-born of Egypt; but it typified our deliverance
from the stroke of vindictive justice, on which account
Christ is called <i>our passover</i>, 1 Cor. v. 7. There was also the
feast of harvest, in which the first-fruits were presented to
God as an acknowledgment that he has a right to the best of
our time and service. There was also the feast of tabernacles;
which not only called to remembrance their dwelling in tents
in the wilderness, but was an acknowledgment that we are
strangers and sojourners upon earth; and was also a type of
Christ, who was expected to come and pitch his tabernacle
among us in his incarnation. There are many other laws, both
judicial and ceremonial, that I might have mentioned; but
since these things are only spoken of occasionally, as being
imparted by God to Israel, by the hand of Moses, from mount
Sinai, at the same time, or soon after, the Ten Commandments
were given, Deut. iv. 12, 13. we shall add no more concerning
them, but proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>To consider what is particularly mentioned in this answer,
concerning God’s giving this abstract of the moral law contained
in them, which were first delivered by a voice; in
which respect God is said to have <i>talked with them face to face</i>,
chap. v. 4. but at the same time there were many ensigns of
terrible majesty attending the delivery of this law; the <i>mountain
burned with fire</i>, Exod. xix. 18. There were <i>lightnings,
thunderings, and earthquakes, and the sound of a trumpet, that
waxed louder and louder; which made the people, and Moses
himself, exceedingly tremble</i>, Exod. xx. 18. Heb. xii. 18, 19.
and there was the ministry of angels who performed that part
of the work which they were employed in on this solemn occasion.
This is described in a majestic style, becoming the
subject insisted on, when it is said, <i>The Lord came from Sinai,
and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount
Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints; from his
right hand went a fiery law</i>, Deut. xxxiii. 2. Their ministry
might probably consist in their forming the thunder, lightnings,
and tempest. Nevertheless, the law was not originally from
them, but given immediately by God. And the design of its
being given in such an awful and majestic way was, that God
might hereby set forth his greatness, and fill them with a reverential
fear of him; and to intimate, that if they did not
yield obedience to him, they were to expect nothing else but
to be consumed by the fire of his jealousy. However, it was
not an intimation that he designed to destroy, but to prove
them; as it is said, that <i>his fear might be before their faces,
that they should not sin</i>, Exod. xx. 20. That which we may
farther observe is, that after God had delivered the Ten Commandments
by words; he wrote them with his own finger, on
two tables of stone; in which the moral law is summarily comprehended;
which is particularly explained in several following
answers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. XCIC.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. XCIX.</span> <i>What rules are to be observed for the right understanding
of the Ten Commandments?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> For the right understanding of the Ten Commandments,
these rules are to be observed,</p>

<p class='c014'>I. That the law is perfect, and bindeth every one to full conformity
in the whole man unto the righteousness thereof,
and unto entire obedience, for ever, so as to require the
utmost perfection of every duty, and to forbid the least decree
of every sin.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>This implies, that how unable soever we are to yield perfect
obedience, yet it does not cease to be a duty. And though
some sins are smaller than others, yet the least is contrary to
the law of God; and therefore not to be committed by us.</p>

<p class='c014'>II. That it is spiritual, and so reacheth the understanding, will,
affections, and all other powers of the soul, as well as words,
works, and gestures.</p>

<p class='c012'>This denotes that obedience ought to be performed in a
spiritual manner. God is to be worshipped with our spirits;
without which, all external modes of worship will avail nothing.
Nevertheless, external worship is to be performed and
expressed by words, works, and gestures; which supposes that
our understandings are rightly informed, or that we do not
worship an unknown God, and that our wills express a readiness
to obey him out of choice, and without the least reluctancy;
and our affections must centre in him, as performing
the duties incumbent on us, with the utmost delight and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c014'>III. That, one and the same thing, in divers respects, is required
or forbidden, in several commandments.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus covetousness is forbidden in the Tenth Commandment.
Nevertheless, as hereby the world is loved more than God, it
is a breach of the first Commandment, and as such is styled
<i>idolatry</i>, Col. iii. 5.</p>

<p class='c014'>IV. That, as, where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is
forbidden, and where a sin is forbidden, the contrary duty
is commanded. So, where a promise is annexed, the contrary
threatening is included; and where a threatening is
annexed, the contrary promise is included.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the fifth Commandment requires us to honour our
superiors; therefore it forbids our reproaching or doing any
thing dishonourable or injurious to them, Matt. xv. 4. The
eight Commandment forbids stealing; and it also requires the
contrary duty, namely, that we should labour for a competent
maintenance, that we may not be exposed to any temptation
thereunto. Thus it is said, <i>Let him that stole, steal no more,
but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing
which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth</i>,
Eph. iv. 28. Moreover, as there is a promise of long life annexed
to the fifth Commandment, this includes the contrary
threatening to those that break it. Thus it is said, <i>The eye
that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall
eat it</i>, Prov. xxx. 17. And on the other hand, whatever
threatening is annexed to any commandment, the contrary promise
is included, and belongs to those that repent of, or abhor,
and turn from the sin therein forbidden. Thus it is said, <i>At
what instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a
kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to destroy it. If
that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their
evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them</i>,
Jer. xviii. 7, 8.</p>

<p class='c014'>V. That what God forbids, is at no time to be done; what he
commands, is always our duty, and yet every particular
duty, is not to be done at all times.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus sin is, under no pretence to be committed. Accordingly
Moses, when he was in a prosperous condition in Pharaoh’s
court, though he might have pretended, that his greatness,
and the advantages which Israel might have expected
from it, might have been an excuse for his continuing to enjoy
the pleasures of sin there. Nevertheless, he was sensible that
this would not exempt him from guilt; therefore <i>he forsook
Egypt, and chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin</i>, Heb. xi. 25. Again,
what God commands is always a duty; so that there is no
season of life in which it ceases to be so: as for instance,
praying, reading, hearing the word, &amp;c. Nevertheless these
duties are not actually to be engaged in every moment of our
lives. It is always our duty to visit the sick, comfort the
afflicted, defend the oppressed; but such objects do not always
present themselves to us, so as to render it our duty at all
times.</p>

<p class='c014'>VI. That, under one sin or duty, all of the same kind are forbidden
or commanded, together with all the causes, means,
occasions, and appearances thereof, and provocations thereunto.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus, according to the fourth Commandment, it is our duty
to sanctify the Sabbath, and consequently to avoid every thing
that may be a means or occasion of our breach of it. In the
sixth Commandment murder is forbidden; so is likewise all
sinful passion or anger with our brethren without a cause,
Matt. v. 22. And in the seventh, adultery is forbidden; so
is also <i>looking on a woman to lust after her</i>, Matt. v. 28. And
as we are obliged to <i>abstain</i> from every sin forbidden, so <i>from
all appearance of evil</i>, 1 Thes. v. 22. or what may be an occasion
of it. Thus <i>fathers</i> are <i>not to provoke their children to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>wrath</i>, Eph. vi. 4. and according to the moral reason of the
command, we are not to provoke any one to wrath, or do that
which may excite their corruptions.</p>

<p class='c014'>VII. That, what is forbidden or commanded to ourselves, we
are bound, according to our places, to endeavour that it may
be avoided or performed by others, according to the duty
of their places.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not to endeavour to prevent sin in others, is, in effect, to
commit it ourselves. Thus Eli contracted the guilt of his sons
crimes, by not endeavouring to prevent them. And persons
are said to <i>hate their brethren in their hearts</i> who <i>do not rebuke
them, but suffer sin upon them</i>, Lev. xix. 17. And Abraham
is commended in that he <i>should command his household
after him, that they should keep the way of the Lord</i>, Gen. xviii.
19. From hence it follows, that it is a duty for parents to
instruct their children in the ways of God, Deut. vi. 6, 7.</p>

<p class='c014'>VIII. That, in what is commanded to others, we are bound
according to our places and callings, to be helpful to them,
and to take heed of partaking with others in what is forbidden
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>That we are to be helpful to others, in that which is their
duty, appears, from our obligation to endeavour that God may
be glorified. Therefore we are, to our utmost, to promote
their faith and joy in Christ. Thus the apostle says, <i>We are
helpers of your joy</i>, 2 Cor. i. 24. And, on the other hand,
we ought to take care that we do not partake with others in
their sin. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>When thou sawest a thief,
then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with
adulterers</i>, Psal. l. 18.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. C., CI., CII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. C.</span> <i>What special things are we to consider in the Ten
Commandments?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We are to consider in the Ten Commandments, the
preface, the substance of the Commandments themselves,
and several reasons annexed to some of them, the more to
inforce them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CI.</span> <i>What is the preface to the Ten Commandments.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The preface to the Commandments is contained in
these words [<i>I am the Lord thy God, who have brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</i>]
wherein God manifesteth his sovereignty, as being Jehovah,
the eternal, immutable, and almighty God, having his being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>in and of himself, and giving being to all his words, and
works; and that he is a God in covenant, as with Israel of
old, so with all his people; who, as he brought them out of
their bondage in Egypt, so he delivereth us from our spiritual
thraldom; and that therefore we are bound to take him
for our God alone, and to keep all his Commandments.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CII.</span> <i>What is the sum of the four Commandments,
which contain our duty to God?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sum of the four Commandments containing our
duty to God, is, to love the Lord our God with all our
heart, and with all our soul, and with all our strength, and
with all our mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>These answers contain some things necessary to be observed;
as,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That the substance of each commandment is to be considered
by us, or what it is, that God enjoins or forbids
therein; in which we find that every Commandment contains
a distinct head of duty, and is to be explained according to
the rules laid down in the foregoing answer. And also that
some of them have reasons annexed to them; which is an instance
of God’s condescending goodness, that besides the consideration
of our obligation to obey whatever he commands,
because it is his will, we may have other motives to enforce
this obedience. What these reasons or motives are, will be
considered in their proper place.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. That here is a general preface, which God has set before
the commandments, which contains several motives to
obedience; some of which were indeed peculiarly adapted to
the Israelites, whereby they were put in mind of their late
deliverance out of the land of Egypt. Nevertheless, if we
consider the moral reason thereof, as this, together with the
subject-matter of the commandments, to which it is prefixed,
may be applied to God’s people under all ages, we shall find
that it extends farther than the obligation which Israel was
under, as delivered from the Egyptian bondage. Therefore
it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That God reveals himself as the Lord, whose name alone
is Jehovah, a God of infinite sovereignty and almighty power,
as well as faithful to his promises; so that whatever he obliges
us to do, or gives us encouragement to expect from him, we
have the highest motive and inducement thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He styles himself his people’s God; and so puts them in
mind of that relation which they stand in to him, as the result
of the covenant of grace, in which he gives them a warrant to
lay claim to those spiritual blessings which he bestows on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>people nigh unto him; and this is considered as a farther obligation
to obedience. The covenant of grace respects either
the external dispensation thereof, which belongs to the church
in general, viz. to all who are made partakers of the glad tidings
of salvation, which are contained in the gospel; or else
that particular claim which believers have to saving blessings
which are made over to them therein, which respects all those
graces which God is pleased to give his people here, and that
glory which he has reserved for them hereafter; and this must
certainly be reckoned the highest motive to duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. As to what respects God’s having brought Israel out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; this is to be
extended farther than that particular providence, which was
then fresh in their memories; and therefore it denotes all the
deliverances which God is pleased to vouchsafe to his people,
whether temporal or spiritual; and in particular, that which
was procured for us by Christ, from the bondage and thraldom
of sin and Satan, the condemning sentence of the law, together
with that salvation which is inseparably connected with it;
which is to be improved by us as an inducement to yield universal
obedience to all God’s commandments.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are some, indeed, who think that this is a part of the
first Commandment, and so the meaning is, Thou art to know,
and practically consider, that I am the Lord thy God, as containing
the affirmative part thereof; and then follows the negative,
Thou shalt have no other gods; or else they suppose it
to be a reason annexed to this Commandment in particular.
But it seems most probable, that it is a preface to all the
Commandments, and accordingly to be applied as a motive to
enforce obedience to every one of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We have farther an account of the sum of the four
Commandments, which contain our duty to God. Here it maybe
observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the sum of all the commandments is love. This is
what the apostle intends, when he says, that <i>the end of the
commandment is charity</i>, or rather <i>love</i>, as it ought to be rendered,
1 Tim. i. 5. and accordingly he says, <i>He that loveth another
hath fulfilled the law</i>, Rom. xiii. 8. This love hath either
God or man for its object, and comprizes in it the duties which
we owe to God and man: and they are all reduced to this general
head; that hereby we may understand; that obedience,
whether it be to God or man, is to be performed with delight;
otherwise it will be a burden to us and unacceptable to him,
who has obliged us to love him and keep his commandments;
because he first loved us.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. These commandments, as they respect our duty to God
and man, are comprized in two tables, which are to be divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>according to their respective objects. Some ancient writers,
indeed, have very injudiciously supposed that the five first
Commandments belong to the first table, and the others to the
second; and so make an equal division thereof; and the Papists
have assigned but three to the first table, making the second
Commandment an appendix to the first; and that the
number ten may be compleat, they divide the tenth Commandment
into two. The reason urged by them for this matter,
will be considered in its proper place; but we are bound to
conclude that the four first Commandments contain the duties
of the first table, which respect those which we immediately
owe to God; and these are to be performed, as our Saviour
says, <i>with all our soul, with all our strength, and with all our
mind</i>, Luke x. 27. which is an idea superior to that which is
contained in the duty we owe to man. And the six last Commandments
contain the duties of the second table, of which our
neighbour is the more immediate object.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this division of the Commandments is just, appears
from what the apostle says, when speaking concerning the duty
contained in the fifth Commandment, <i>Honour thy father
and mother</i>, who calls it <i>the first Commandment with promise</i>,
Eph. vi. 2. Whereas it is not the first Commandment that has
a promise annexed to it, since the second Commandment contains
a promise of mercy to thousands of them that love God
and keep his commandments; nor is it the first of the ten Commandments.
Therefore the apostle can intend nothing hereby
but that it is the first Commandment of the second table.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now we are considering the Commandments as thus
contained in two tables, and distinguished with respect to the
more immediate objects thereof, we may farther observe; that
though both of them are enjoined by the authority of God, and
consequently are equally binding, so that the obedience which
is acceptable in his sight, must be so extensive, as that we must
<i>have respect to all his commandments</i>, Psal. cxix. 6. Yet it may
be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That the duties of the first table, in which we have to
do with God as the more immediate object thereof, are to be
considered as acts of religious worship, whereby we not only
confess our obligation to obey him; but in performing it, adore
and magnify his divine perfections as the highest end and reason
thereof; which is not included in the idea of the duties
which we owe to our neighbour, as contained in the commandments
of the second table. These, indeed are to be religiously
observed, not from any circumstance respecting our neighbour,
but as duties which we perform in obedience to God<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c013'><sup>[204]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>(2.) Though the principal and most excellent branch of religion
consists in our obeying the commandments of the first
table; yet our obedience is not only defective, but unacceptable
to God, if we neglect to perform those of the second. And,
on the other hand, the performance of the duties of the second
table is not sufficient to denominate a person a religious man,
who lives in the neglect of those which are contained in the
first.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The duties which we owe to our neighbour, as contained
in the second table, are, for the most part, to give way to
those which we owe to God, pursuant to those which are enjoined
in the first, especially when they are considered as standing
in competition with them. Thus we are obliged, in the
fifth Commandment, to obey our parents or superiors. Nevertheless,
if they command us to break the Sabbath, profane the
name of God, or attend on such worship which he has not required,
we are to disobey them, or to <i>obey God rather than
men</i>, Acts iv. 19. And elsewhere it is said, <i>If thy brother, the
son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of
thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee
secretly, saying, Let us go, and serve other gods: thou shalt not
consent unto him, nor hearken unto him</i>, Deut. xiii. 6, 8. This
our Saviour calls <i>hating father and mother, wife, children, and
brethren</i>, Luke xiv, 26. without which we cannot be his disciples.
By which he intends, that if the love which we otherwise
owe to them, be inconsistent with that obedience which he requires
of his followers; or, if we cannot oblige them, and at
the same time perform the duties which we owe to him, the
inferior obligation must give way to the superior.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CIII., CIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CIII.</span> <i>Which is the first commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The first commandment is, <i>Thou shalt have no other
gods before me</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CIV.</span> <i>What are the duties required in the first commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the first commandment, are, the
knowing and acknowledging of God to be the only true God,
and our God; and to worship and glorify him accordingly,
by thinking, meditating, remembering, highly esteeming,
honouring, adoring, choosing, loving, desiring, fearing of
him, believing him, trusting, hoping, delighting, rejoicing in
him, being zealous for him, calling upon him, giving all
praise and thanks, and yielding all obedience and submission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>to him, with the whole man, being careful in all things
to please him, and sorrowful when in any thing he is offended,
and walking humbly with him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The duties required in this Commandment, are contained
in three general heads.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We are obliged to know God. This supposes that our
understanding is rightly informed as to what relates to the divine
perfections, which are displayed in the works of creation
and providence, by which we are led into the knowledge of his
eternal power and Godhead; and this is called the natural
knowledge of God: but that knowledge which we are to endeavour
to attain, who have a brighter manifestation of his perfections
in the gospel, is of a far more excellent and superior
nature; inasmuch as herein we see the glory of God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost; or behold the perfections of the
divine nature, as displayed in and through a Mediator; which
is that knowledge which is absolutely necessary to salvation,
as our Saviour says, <i>This is life eternal; that they might know
thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent</i>,
John xvii. 3. By this means we not only know what God is,
but our interest in him, and the foundation which we have of
our being accepted in his sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are farther commanded to acknowledge or make a
visible profession of our subjection to God, and in particular,
to Christ, as our great Mediator: His name, interest, and glory,
should be most dear to us; and we are, on all occasions, to
testify, that we count it our glory to be his servants, and to
make it appear that he is the supreme object of our desire and
delight, as the Psalmist says, <i>I cried unto thee, O Lord, I said,
Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living</i>,
Psal cxlii. 5. And elsewhere, <i>Whom have I in heaven but thee,
and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee</i>, Psal.
lxxiii. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are farther obliged by this Commandment, to worship
and glorify God, pursuant to what we know, and the profession
we make of him as the true God and our God. To
worship and glorify God, is to ascribe all possible glory and
perfection to him, and to have our hearts suitably affected
therewith, as sensible of that infinite distance which we stand
at from him. This is considered under several heads, which
contain the substance of what is required in this Commandment;
as,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We must make God the subject of our daily meditation;
calling to mind what he is in himself, and what he is to us, or
does for us; which is to be considered as a means to preserve
us from sin, and a spur, to duty, a motive to holy fear and reverence.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>2. We are to honour, adore, and fear him for his greatness.
Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Who in the heaven can be compared unto
the Lord; who among the sons of the mighty can be likened
to the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assemblies of the
saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him</i>,
Psal. lxxxix. 6, 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. As God is the best good, and has promised that he will
be a God to us; so he is to be desired, loved, delighted, and
rejoiced in, and chosen by us; as the prophet says, ‘With my
soul have I desired thee in the night,’ Isa. xxvi. 9. and the
church, ‘I sat down under his shadow with great delight,’
Cant. ii. 3. and the apostle, ‘Lord, thou knowest that I love
thee,’ John xxi. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. As he is a God of truth, we are to believe all that he has
spoken; and in particular, what he has revealed in his promises
or threatnings, relating to mercies which he will bestow,
or judgments which he will inflict. Thus our Saviour says,
‘If I say the truth, why do ye not believe me,’ John viii. 46.
And it is said, when Israel ‘saw that great work which the
Lord did upon the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord,
and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses,’ Exod. xiv.
31.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. As he is able to save to the utmost, and faithful in fulfilling
all his promises, we are to trust him with all we have from
him, and for all those blessings which we hope to receive at his
hands. Thus the prophet says, ‘Trust ye in the Lord for ever;
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength,’ Isa. xxvi. 4.
And the apostle speaks of his <i>having committed</i> all to him, 2
Tim. i. 11. as the consequence of what he knew him to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When the name, interest, and glory of God is opposed in
the world, we are to express an holy zeal for it. Thus the prophet
Elijah says, ‘I have been very jealous for the Lord God
of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with
the sword,’ 1 Kings xix. 10. And as to what concerns our
conversation in general, we are to be ‘not slothful in business,
but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,’ Rom. xii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Since he is a God hearing prayer, we are daily to call
upon him, ‘O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh
come,’ Psal. lxv. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. As he is the God of all our mercies, we are to thank and
praise him for them. Thus the Psalmist says, ‘O give thanks
unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth for
ever,’ Psal. cxxxvi. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. His sovereignty and dominion over us, calls for subjection
and obedience, and a constant care to please him, and approve
ourselves to him in all things. Thus the apostle says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>‘Submit yourselves to God,’ James iv. 7. And the Psalmist
speaks of a person’s ‘cleansing his way, by taking heed thereto
according to his word,’ Psal. cxix. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. As he is an holy, jealous, and sin-hating God, we are
to be filled with grief and sorrow of heart when he is offended,
either by ourselves or others, as Ephraim says, ‘I was ashamed,
yea, even confounded; because I did bear the reproach
of my youth,’ Jer. xxxi. 19. And the Psalmist, ‘Rivers
of waters run down mine eyes, because they,’ that is, the
world in general, ‘keep not thy law,’ Psal. cxxix. 136.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. A sense of our unworthiness and daily infirmities should
excite us to <i>walk humbly with God</i>. This is enjoined as a necessary
duty, Mic. vi. 8. and is called a <i>being clothed with humility</i>,
1 Pet. v. 5. Thus concerning the duties required in
this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which may be farther observed is, that it is fitly placed
before all the other Commandments, because it is, from the nature
of the thing, necessary to our performing the duties which
are required in them. The object of worship must first be
known before we can apply ourselves, in a right manner, to
perform any duty prescribed, whether respecting God or man.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be also farther considered, that it is not an easy matter
to keep the Commandment, because of the spirituality and
vast extent thereof, and the many graces that are to be exercised
by those that would perform it aright; and therefore we
ought earnestly to beg of God that our hearts may be set aright
with him, and inclined and excited hereunto by him;
which is a peculiar blessing to be desired and expected from
the Holy Spirit. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Incline mine heart
unto thy testimonies</i>, Psal. cxix. 36.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CV., CVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CV.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the first Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the first Commandment, are,
Atheism, in denying, or not having a God; idolatry, in
having, or worshipping more gods than one, or any with, or
instead of the true God; the not having and avouching him
for God, and our God; the omission or neglect of any thing
due to him required in this Commandment, ignorance, forgetfulness,
misapprehensions, false opinions, unworthy and
wicked thoughts of him, bold and curious searching into his
secrets, all profaneness, hatred of God, self-love, self-seeking,
and all other inordinate and immoderate setting of our
mind, will, or affections upon other things, and taking them
off from him, in whole or in part; vain credulity, unbelief,
heresy, misbelief, distrust, despair, incorrigibleness, insensibleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>under judgments, hardness of heart, pride, presumption,
carnal security, tempting of God, using unlawful means,
and trusting in lawful means, carnal delights and joys; corrupt,
blind, and indiscreet zeal, lukewarmness, and deadness
in the things of God, estranging ourselves, and apostatizing
from God, praying, or giving any religious worship to saints,
angels, or any other creatures, all compacts, and consulting
with the devil, and hearkening to his suggestions, making
men the lords of our faith and conscience, slighting and
despising God and his commandments, resisting and grieving
of his Spirit, discontent, and impatience at his dispensations,
charging him foolishly for the evils he inflicts on
us, and ascribing the praise of any good we either are, have,
or can do, to fortune, idols, ourselves, or any other creature.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CVI.</span> <i>What are we especially taught by these words</i>
(before me) <i>in the first Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> These words <i>before me</i>, or before my face, in the first
Commandment, teach us, that God who seeth all things,
takes special notice of, and is much displeased with the sin
of having any other god; that so it may be an argument to
dissuade from it, and to aggravate it, as a most impudent
provocation, as also to persuade us to do, as in his sight,
whatever we do in his service.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sins forbidden in this Commandment may be reduced
to two general heads, Atheism and Idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, Atheism; whereby men are so far from taking God
for their God, that they deny that there is a God; or, at least,
that he is what he has revealed himself to be. Thus the wicked
man, who is styled a <i>fool</i>, is represented as <i>saying in his
heart, There is no God</i>. Psal. xiv. 1. This Atheism is either
speculative or practical. The former of these is that which is
seated in the minds and consciences of men; who are so far
blinded, perverted, and deluded, as to think that there is no
God. Though, indeed, there are very few among these who
are so bold and profane as to deny this truth when they attend
to the dictates of nature, or duly exercise those reasoning faculties
with which God has endowed them; which, if they
neglect to do, they must be reckoned but one remove from
brutes. Some, indeed, are ready to wish that there were no
God, or inclined to deny those divine perfections that are
essential to him, cast contempt on his government, or, it may
be, deny a providence; which is, in effect, to deny that there
is a God. Though it must be observed, that none proceed to
this degree of wickedness, till, by a long continuance in sin,
they are given up to judicial hardness of heart, and blindness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>of mind, Rom. i. 28. Eph. iv. 17-20. And even these have
been forced, at some times, to confess that there is a God, with
whom is terrible majesty; when he has broken in on their consciences,
and filled them with the dreadful apprehensions of
his wrath, as a sin-revenging Judge. But where there is one
speculative Atheist, there are a thousand practical ones, who
live without God in the world; and these are described in this
answer, as being guilty of those sins which none who duly
consider his divine perfections would venture to commit.</p>

<p class='c006'>To enlarge on every one of those instances, particularly
mentioned in this answer, in which this sin is supposed to consist,
would require a distinct treatise, and be inconsistent with
our designed brevity in explaining the Ten Commandments.
All that we shall therefore attempt at present, shall be to consider
some instances, in which practical Atheism discovers
itself, together with the aggravations of this sin; and then we
shall enquire what judgment we are to pass concerning those
who complain of atheistical and blasphemous thoughts; and
consider whether this be a degree of that Atheism which we
are speaking of; together with the causes of this sin, and the
remedies against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The instances in which practical Atheism discovers itself.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. They are chargeable with it who are grossly ignorant, and
know nothing of God but the name, being utter strangers to
those perfections whereby he makes himself known to the
world, or who entertain carnal conceptions of him, as though
he were altogether such an one as ourselves, Psal. l. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When persons, though they know, in some measure, what
God is, yet never seriously exercise their thoughts about him;
which forgetfulness is a degree of Atheism, and will be severely
punished by him, Psal. ix. 17. and l. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When persons maintain corrupt doctrines, and dangerous
heresies, subversive of the fundamental articles of faith, and
contrary to the divine perfections. Of this kind are those that
militate against his sovereignty and dominion over the wills,
consciences and affections of man; when persons conclude that
his counsels and determinations may be disannulled or defeated;
or when we suppose that he changes, as we do; or when,
under a pretence of advancing one perfection, we set aside the
glory of another, when in order to magnify his mercy, we disregard
his holiness or justice, and so presume of being happy
without being holy; or when we give way to despairing
thoughts, from the consideration of his vindictive justice, without
improving the displays of his mercy, as set forth in the
gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When we repine and quarrel at his providence, and pretend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>to find fault with the dispensations thereof, or charge
God foolishly, and go about to prescribe laws to him, who is
the Governor of the world, and may do what he will with the
work of his hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. When we refuse to engage in those acts of religious
worship which he has appointed, or to attend on his ordinances,
in which we may hope for his presence and blessing.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. When we behave ourselves, in the conduct of our lives,
as though we were not accountable to him, and had no reason
to be afraid of his judgments. Accordingly, when we set our
affections on other things, and take them off from him, when
we are guilty of wilful impenitency and unbelief, and are incorrigible
under divine rebukes; when our hearts and lives
are estranged from him, as though we desired not the knowledge
of his ways; when we resist and grieve his Spirit, are
discontented and impatient under his hand, or ascribe that to
second causes, or think that those things come by chance
which are under the direction of his providence. In these,
and many other instances, persons are notoriously guilty of
practical Atheism, which is forbidden in this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider the aggravations and dreadful
consequences of this sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is contrary to the light of nature, and the dictates of
conscience, a disregarding those impressions which God has
made of his glory on the souls of men. And in those who
have been favoured with the revelation of the grace of God
in the gospel, in which his perfections have been set forth to
the utmost, it is a shutting our eyes against the light and casting
contempt on that which should raise our admiration, and excite
in us the highest esteem of him whom we practically disown
and deny.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is directly opposite to, and entirely inconsistent with
all religion, and opens a door to the greatest degree of licentiousness.
To live without God in the world, is to give the
reins to our own corruptions; it is not barely a sin of infirmity
or inadvertency, but a running in all excess of riot; and therefore
the consequence hereof must be dreadful; for that which
strikes at the very being of God, cannot but expose the sinner
to the sorest condemnation. But since there are some sins
mentioned in this answer, which contain a degree of practical
atheism; which believers themselves are prone to fall into,
and complain of, as forgetfulness of God, unbelief, distrust of
his providence, insensibleness under judgments, too great a
degree of hardness of heart, pride, carnal security, discontent
and impatience under his dispensations; this may tend very
much to discourage them, and make them conclude that they
are not in a state of grace; especially when they find, as sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>they do, atheistical and blasphemous thoughts suggested
to their minds. Therefore we must inquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What judgment we are to pass concerning those who
are ready to charge themselves with practical atheism, especially
as to what respects those unbecoming thoughts and conceptions
which they sometimes have of the divine Majesty?
whether this be altogether inconsistent with the truth of grace,
together with the causes thereof, and the remedies against it?
It is certain, that the best of God’s people are sanctified but
in part, and therefore are prone to commit those sins which
seem to contain in them a denial, at least, a neglect of that regard
which we ought to have for the divine perfections, and
especially when we are not only followed with vain, but blasphemous
thoughts; which gives great disturbance to us, when
engaged in holy duties. This ought to be reckoned a very
great affliction, and occasion many searchings of heart; since
sometimes it brings much guilt with it. Nevertheless, we are
not always from hence to conclude that we are in a state of
unregeneracy. It is the prevalency of corruption, or the dominion
of sin, which is inconsistent with the truth of grace,
not the remainders thereof. A person may have faith, who
yet complains of unbelief; he may have a due regard to God,
as to what respects the course and tenor of his actions; but
yet, in many instances, be chargeable with forgetfulness of
him. He may have a love to him, and yet sometimes be
guilty of indiscreet zeal, on the one hand, or lukewarmness
and deadness of heart, on the other; his mind and affections
may be sanctified, and yet he be sometimes followed with
atheistical and blasphemous thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have instances in scripture of good men, who have
spoken, not only unadvisedly, but, as we may term it wickedly
with their lips. Thus Job is justly reproved by Elihu for
charging God with <i>finding occasions against him; putting his
feet in the stocks, and marking all his paths</i>, Job xxxiii. 10,
11. as though his dealings with him had been unjust and
severe; especially when he says at the same time, <i>I am clean,
and without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity
in me</i>, ver. 9. And Jonah, when he was reproved by
God for his passionate behaviour towards him, vindicates himself,
and says, <i>I do well to be angry, even unto death</i>, Jonah
iv. 9. These are expressions that favour of a degree of
Atheism; and so do those unbecoming conceptions of God,
whereby our thoughts are sometimes defiled and depraved.
But it is one thing to be guilty of this through surprise and
the prevalency of temptation; and another thing to have those
thoughts indulged by, and lodged in us unrepented of.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there are some instances in which believers are afflicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>with atheistical and blasphemous thoughts, when it is hard
to say that they contract guilt thereby, or, at least, it must
only be reckoned an infirmity arising from this imperfect state;
and that more especially when they are injected by Satan, and
are without the consent of our wills; but treated with the utmost
abhorrence, constantly bewailed and resisted with all our
might; more particularly when we take occasion hereby to
exercise those graces which discover that we have other apprehensions
of God than what are suggested at those times,
when we are hurried by these temptations, and can scarce say,
that we have the government of our own thoughts; especially
if we are able to say, at such a time as our Saviour did, when
unadvisedly tempted by Peter, who, was at that time the Devil’s
instrument, to persuade him to relinquish the work which he
came into the world about. <i>Get thee behind me Satan, thou
art an offence to me</i>, Matt. xvi. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us to consider the causes of such atheistical
and blasphemous thoughts. Sometimes they proceed from a
neglect of waiting on God in his ordinances, or indulging a
carnal and stupid frame of spirit therein, and not maintaining
that holy reverence, or becoming sense of his all-seeing eye,
which we ought always to have. Moreover, there is nothing
that has a greater tendency hereunto, than our conversing with
those who make religion the subject of their profane wit and
drollery; especially if we do this out of choice, and do not at
the same time testify a just abhorrence of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those remedies which are to be made use of to fence
against, and cure the sinfulness of our thoughts in such-like
instances; it behoves us to repent of those sins, which may
have been the occasion of, or given rise to them. And inasmuch
as it is not in our own power to govern our hearts
or affections, or restrain the breaking forth of corruption; it is
necessary for us to commit our souls into Christ’s hands, with
earnest supplications to him that he would sanctify, regulate,
and cleanse our thoughts, and bring us into, and keep us in a
good frame. We ought also to desire, seek after, and improve
all opportunities of conversing with those whose discourse is
holy and profitable, Mal. iii. 16. by which means our affections
may be raised, and our thoughts tinctured with divine things,
which will leave an abiding impression behind them, Luke
xxiv. 32. Which leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, To consider this Commandment as forbidding
idolatry. Thus, when it is said, <i>Thou shalt have no other
gods</i>; the meaning is, thou shalt not worship idols, or set a
creature in the place of God, or pay that regard to it that is
due to him alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it may not be inconvenient to consider the difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>between idolatry as it is a breach of the first and second commandment.
As it is a breach of the first Commandment, it
contains in it a giving divine honour to that which is not God;
but as it is against the second Commandment, it is a worshipping
God by the creature, to whom an inferior kind of worship
is given. Thus when the Papists worship God by images,
supposing them to be a help to their devotion, or a means of
performing that worship which they pretend to be given ultimately
to God. Or when they ascribe any branch of divine
glory to saints or angels; notwithstanding what they say to
exculpate themselves from the breach of the first Commandment,
they are justly chargeable with the breach of the second.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are here to consider, the idolatry more especially that
is forbidden in the first Commandment. Which is either what
is more gross, such as that which is found among the heathen;
or that which is more secret, and may be found in the hearts
of all, and is discovered by the practice of multitudes of Christians,
who profess the utmost detestation of idolatry in the
other sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to idolatry, in the former sense, together with the rise
and progress thereof. In considering the first rise of it we
may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That it proceeded from the ignorance and pride of man,
who, though he could not but know, by the light of nature,
that there is a God; yet being ignorant of his perfections, or
of what he has revealed himself to be in his word, was disposed
to frame those ideas of God, which took their rise from
his own invention. Accordingly the apostle says, <i>When ye
knew not God, ye did service unto them, which, by nature, are
no gods</i>, Gal. iv. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When iniquity abounded in the world, and men withdrew
from, and cast contempt on the ordinances of God, they
invented and worshipped new gods. This some suppose Cain
and his posterity did, when he <i>went out from the presence of
the Lord</i>, Gen. iv. 16. and the <i>sons</i> of God, that is, the church,
when they contracted marriages with the <i>daughters of men</i>,
chap. vi. 2. and joined with them in idolatry; so that it is no
wonder if persons leave the true worship of God, that they
should chuse to themselves other gods.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Hereupon God gave them up to judicial blindness; so
that they <i>worshipped the host of heaven</i>, Acts vii. 42. as the
apostle says the Heathen did.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) As to what concerns the idolatry which was practised
among the Israelites, that took its rise from the fond ambition
which they had to be like other nations, who were abhorred of
God; counting this a fashionable religion, and finding the true
worshippers of God to be fewer in number than the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>world, so that, as the prophet speaks, they were <i>like a speckled
bird</i>, despised and hated by the Heathen <i>round about them</i>,
Jer. xii. 9. they approved of, and learned their ways. It was
this that occasioned Solomon to <i>cleave to them in love</i>, 1 Kings
xi. 2. which was not much unlike to the argument used by
Demetrius and his followers, why Diana should be worshipped;
namely, <i>because all Asia and the world worshipped her</i>,
Acts xix. 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) The Devil was permitted, for the trial of the faith of
God’s people, and as an instance of his righteous judgment on
his enemies, to abuse the unthinking part of the world by various
signs and lying wonders. Thus we read of <i>prophets</i>,
and <i>dreamers of dreams</i>, who gave forth signs and wonders,
which God sometimes judicially suffered to come to pass;
whereby many took occasion to go <i>after other gods</i>, Deut.
xiii. 1-3. and Antichrist is said <i>to come after the working of
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders</i>, 2 Thess.
ii. 9. This was managed by the craft and covetousness of the
priests, who made a gain of it, and amused the common people
thereby. And the Heathen oracles, so much spoken of by
ancient writers, which gave countenance to their idolatry, are
reckoned, by some, to have been no other than a contrivance
of those who had little else but secular interest in view. And
when they predicted things future, or revealed secrets, this
was generally done in doubtful expressions: so that whether
the thing really came to pass or no, the end designed might be
answered thereby; and doubtless there was a hand of Satan
herein, to harden the world in that idolatry which was then
practised by them. The gods they worshipped were as numerous
as the countries and kingdoms where idolatry prevailed;
accordingly every nation, yea, every city had its particular
god and distinct modes of worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] Some worshipped the sun, moon, and stars, supposing
that their regular motion and influence on earthly bodies, was
not to be attributed to the all-wise providence of God, but to
some intelligent being, which resided in, and gave that motion
and influence to them: upon the account whereof they worshipped
them as gods. This some did in that early age in
which Job lived, Job xxxi. 26. and the Israelites were warned
against it, Deut. iv. 19. And afterwards we read of <i>idolatrous
priests</i>, who <i>burnt incense to the sun, and to the moon, and to
the planets, and to all the host of heaven</i>, and dedicated <i>horses
and chariots to the sun</i>, 2 Kings xxiii. 5, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Others worshipped the earth, and many creatures therein,
especially those that they received a more than ordinary
advantage from. Thus the Egyptians worshipped the river
Nile; by the overflowing of which, their country was rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>fertile. And some who lived in maritime towns, worshipped
the sea, thinking thereby to prevent an inundation from it.
And the Philistines worshipped Dagon; inasmuch, as living
near the sea, it afforded them plenty of fish.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Others worshipped those parts of the earth which they
most delighted in; such as gardens, woods, groves, springs,
<i>&amp;c.</i> which they supposed to be inhabited by some gods, who
produced the advantages which they received hereby, without
regarding the providence of God, to which every thing is to
be ascribed, that the earth brings forth for the support and delight
of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Others supposed that there were particular gods, who
had the oversight of men, succeeded their undertakings in the
various affairs of life, conducted them when travelling by sea
or land, gave good or ill success to their secular employments,
and preserved them in sickness and health; and accordingly
they paid divine adoration to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] Others expressed the regard they had to virtue by
worshipping some men after their death, who had signalized
themselves by inventing some things which were of common
advantage to mankind while they lived. And the Romans
were so much addicted to this practice of idolatry, that some
of their emperors, though tyrants and monsters in wickedness,
while they lived, obliged their subjects to perpetuate their memories
by worshipping them as gods when they were dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] Some were so stupid, as that they worshipped stocks
and stones, ascribing divinity to them; in which they acted
below the reason of intelligent creatures. Thus the prophet
speaks of their idols as first <i>growing in the wood</i>, then <i>framed
by the smith</i>, or carpenter, <i>into gods</i>, and afterwards <i>worshipped
by them</i>, Isa. xliv. 9-17. And the Psalmist, on this occasion,
justly observes, <i>They that make them are like them; so
is every one that trusteth in them</i>, Psal. cxv. 4-7, compared
with 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might, under this head, consider some things mentioned
in scripture; in which idolaters not only acted contrary to the
dictates of reason, but discovered themselves to be cruel and
inhuman in their modes of worship. Thus Baal’s worshippers
in Ahab’s time, cut themselves with knives and lancets, till
the blood gushed out of them, 1 Kings xviii. 28. and others
made their children pass through the fire, in the worship they
paid to Molech, or the sun, which the Psalmist refers to, when
he says, <i>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and
of their daughters</i>, Psal. cvi. 37, 38. This, indeed, some
think, intends nothing else but their passing between two fires;
so that they were scorched by them. Yet others, with greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>reason, suppose that they were inclosed in that brazen idol,
and so burnt to death in the most barbarous manner<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c013'><sup>[205]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use which we ought to make of this doctrine, should
be to excite us to bless God for the clear light of the gospel,
whereby we are led to turn from dead idols to serve the living
and true God: nevertheless we are to take heed lest we be
chargeable with heart-idolatry; whereby we may be said to
break this Commandment, though it be in a different way
from that in which the Heathen did. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That idolatry which is sometimes found among Christians;
who, though they abhor the thoughts of giving divine
worship to a creature, yet, if they look into their own hearts,
will have reason to charge themselves with those things which
are in scripture called idolatry; namely, when they put any
thing in the room of God, or love it more than him; and this
may be considered in the following instances.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Self may be reckoned among those idols which many,
who make profession of the true religion, pay a greater regard
to than to God. Thus the apostle, speaking concerning the
great degeneracy of the world, among other things, says, that
<i>men should be lovers of their ownselves</i>, 2 Tim. iii. 2. so that
self-love turns away the heart from God, and excludes all
practical religion. This we may be said to be guilty of; in
which respect we are chargeable with heart-idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When we reject, or refuse to give credit to any of the
great doctrines contained in divine revelation, unless we are
able to comprehend them within the shallow limits of our
own understandings; upon which account some are inclined
to treat the most sacred mysteries of our religion with contempt;
and for the same reason they might as well deny and
disbelieve what is said concerning the infinite perfections of the
divine nature, because they cannot be comprehended by us.
This is no other than a setting up our own understanding,
which is weak and liable to err, in opposition to the wisdom of
God, and, in some respects, a giving superior glory to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When we are resolute and incorrigible under the various
rebukes of providence, and persist in our rebellion against
God, notwithstanding the threatenings which he has denounced,
or the judgments which he executes. When the will of man
is obstinately set on those things which are directly contrary
to the will of God; and, though we are warned of the danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>thereof, resolve notwithstanding, to add rebellion to our iniquities,
like the wild ass used to the wilderness, or the swift
dromedary traversing her ways, that cannot be easily turned
out of her course. In this respect the will of man is set in
opposition to God; and therefore he is, for this reason, justly
chargeable with idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) This also discovers itself in our affections, when they
are either set on unlawful objects, or immoderately pursue
those that would otherwise be lawful; when we love these
things which God hates, or covet what he has expressly forbidden,
as Achan did the wedge of gold, and the Babylonish
garment; upon which account <i>covetousness</i> is, by the apostle,
called <i>idolatry</i>, Col. iii. 5. And to this we may add, that we
are chargeable with this sin, when we <i>make provision for the
flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof</i>, Rom. xiii, 14. Thus the apostle
speaks of some <i>whose god is their belly</i>, Phil. iii. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as for those things which are otherwise lawful, we
may be guilty of idolatry in the immoderate pursuit of them,
when they take up too much of our thoughts, time, and concern;
when our affections are so much set upon them, as though
we had nothing better to mind; when we are not willing to
part with them when God calls for them at our hands, and are
more cast down at the loss of them, than we are when deprived
of those spiritual blessings which are of the highest importance.
In these instances we may be said to set up self as our
idol in opposition to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that there is a more subtle kind
of idolatry, whereby self enters into, and takes its place in
those religious duties, which believers are engaged in. Thus
when they attempt to perform them in their own strength, as
though they had a sufficiency in themselves, and had no occasion
to depend on the almighty power of God to work in them
that which is pleasant in his sight. And we are farther guilty
of this sin, when, through the pride of our hearts, we are apt
to applaud ourselves when we have performed some religious
duties, and expect to be justified thereby; which is a setting
up self as an idol, in the room of Christ. And lastly, when
self is the end designed in what we do in matters of religion,
and so robs God of that glory which is due to his name.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There is another idol, which is put in the room of God;
and that is the world. When the profits, pleasures, or honours
thereof are thought of with the greatest delight, as though
they were our chief good, and pursued with more earnestness
than Christ’s interest and glory. When it has not only the
highest place in our affections, but, as it were, engrosses them;
this is that love of the world which, as the apostle says, is inconsistent
with the love of the Father, 1 John ii. 15. and denotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>us guilty of that idolatry which we are now speaking of;
more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When our thoughts are so much engaged in the pursuit
of it, that we grow not only cold and remiss as to spiritual
things; but allow ourselves no time for serious meditations on
them, or converse with God in secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When the world has our first and last thoughts every
day; when we are so far from following the Psalmist’s example,
when he says, <i>When I awake, I am still with thee</i>, Psal.
cxxxix. 18. as considering ourselves under the care of providence,
and beholden to God for the mercies which we enjoy,
that we are taken up with nothing else but the projects and
schemes which we lay for the gaining or increasing our wealth,
or worldly estate therein. And this having been the great
business of the day, takes up and engages our wakeful thoughts
by night, as though it were the main work and business of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When we pursue the world, without depending on God
for his blessing to attend our lawful undertakings, and do not
consider the good things thereof as his special gift, nor the
disappointments that attend us therein, as ordered by his overruling
providence, to engage us to walk more closely with
him, and take up our rest in him as our only happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] When our hearts are hereby hardened, and grow cold
and indifferent in religion, or when it follows and disturbs us
in holy duties, and renders us formal in the discharge thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] When the riches, honours, and pleasures of the world
have a tendency to quiet our spirits, and give us full satisfaction,
though under spiritual declensions, and destitute of the
special presence of God, which is our greatest happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] When we fret, or repine at the providence of God, under
the disappointments we meet with in our secular affairs in
the world. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] When we despise the members of Christ, because they
are poor in the world, are ashamed of his cross, and refuse to
bear reproach for his sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) There is another instance of heart-idolatry, <i>viz.</i> when
we adhere to the dictates of Satan, and regard his suggestions
more than the convictions of our own consciences, or the Holy
Spirit. Satan’s design in his temptations, is to turn us away
from God; and when we are drawn aside thereby, we may be
said to obey him rather than God. This is what all are more
or less guilty of; but some are said, in an uncommon degree,
to be his servants. Thus the apostle Paul styles the <i>sorcerer,
who sought to turn aside the deputy from the faith, a child of
the devil</i>, Acts xiii. 10. and our Saviour tells the Jews, <i>Ye are
of your father the devil; and the lusts of your father ye will
do</i>, &amp;c. John viii. 44. He is also called <i>The god of this world</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>2 Cor. iv. 4. and <i>the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience</i>, Eph. ii. 2.
and accordingly he attempts to usurp the throne of God; by
which means he has led a great part of the world after him.
And, as he tempted our Saviour to fall down and worship
him, Matt. iv. 9. though without success, he prevails upon
others to do it to their own ruin. Here it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That he has propagated several doctrines, in opposition
to the gospel; and, indeed, all those doctrines which are subversive
thereof, take their rise from him. Thus the apostle,
speaks of some who, <i>in the latter times, should depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</i>,
1 Tim. iv. 1. This they do when they depart from the way
of truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] He has sometimes invented those modes of worship,
which have been observed by some, in imitation of the sacrifices
which God had ordained; and whatever pretence there
might be of religion herein, he had doubtless a design, by this
means, to set up himself, in opposition to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] He has amused and hardened the hearts of his subjects,
by pretended miracles, designed to oppose, and lessen the credit
of those real miracles which have been wrought, to confirm
the truth, by the finger of God, Exod. viii. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] He has endeavoured to extirpate the true religion, by
raising persecutions against the faithful worshippers of God;
which has been his constant practice, so far as he has been
permitted, in all ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] He has excited, in some of his subjects, the greatest
degree of hatred, opposition to, and rebellion against God.
Thus he <i>entered into the heart of Judas</i>, Luke xxii. 3. and
<i>filled the heart of Ananias, that he lied to the Holy Ghost</i>, Acts
v. 3. and has hardened the hearts of others, that they bade defiance
to the Almighty, as Pharaoh, who said, <i>Who is the
Lord, that I should obey his voice?</i> Exod. v. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] He has persuaded many of his subjects to enter into a
kind of confederacy with him, and with one another, to promote
his wicked designs. Thus those wretched Jews did,
who <i>bound themselves under a curse, that they would neither
eat or drink till they had killed Paul</i>, Acts xxiii. 14. And we
read of others who had <i>made a covenant with death and with
hell</i>, Isa. xxviii. 15. The vilest instances of sins of this nature,
were found among some who used sorcery, divination,
witch-craft, and other diabolical practices; which is so horrid
a crime, and so contrary to the dictates of human nature, that
had we not an account of some in scripture, who used those
abominable arts, we should be ready to think that none were
ever guilty of them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>I will not deny but that many things, which are commonly
related concerning witch-craft and sorcery, as practised in latter
ages, are fabulous and incredible; and some things, said
to be done by the power of the Devil, may be accounted for
by natural causes; and others are ascribed to it, which are
performed by the concealed arts of some who get a livelihood
by cheating the unthinking part of mankind: nevertheless, I
am far from thinking that the account we have hereof in scripture,
is without any manner of foundation, as some modern
writers suggest. That famous story of the witch of Endor,
mentioned in 1 Sam. xxviii. 7-20. is an argument that there
were such persons, at that time, in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible that it will be objected to this, that she was a
cunning woman, who lived by her wits, and deceived Saul, by
pretending that she used some infernal art, as expedient to
bring him to the speech of Samuel; which it may not be amiss
for us to inquire into. Therefore let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is by no means to be supposed that she raised
Samuel from the dead; for it is out of the Devil’s power to
call the soul of a saint out of heaven, with a design to subserve
his interest thereby, and to set up his kingdom in opposition
to Christ’s; and it is not reasonable to suppose that Samuel
should do the Devil so much service after his death, who was
so great an enemy to him in his life. Besides, he was buried
at Ramah, 1 Sam. xxv. 1. and can we think that he should be
now raised at Endor?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, On the other hand, we are not to imagine, that it was
a mere trick or juggle of the woman, whereby she imposed on
Saul; for though it is true, he did not see a shape, yet he heard
a voice, and made a reply thereunto. Moreover we read, that
he had an intimation given him, that Israel should be delivered
into the hands of the Philistines; and that he and his sons
should be with him to-morrow; that, is in the state of the
dead; which the woman was not cunning enough to foretel;<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c013'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
or if she had guessed that it would be so, she would hardly
have ventured to tell Saul such ungrateful tidings; which, if
he had lived to see himself cheated, and her prediction confuted,
it would have endangered her life. Had it been nothing
but a cheat or juggle, she would rather have told him, that he
would be safe and victorious; for which, if it had come to pass,
she might have expected a reward; and if not, she had nothing
to fear from him as a just punishment of her impiety.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We must therefore suppose, that she was a professed
servant of the Devil, and <i>had</i>, as the text says, <i>a familiar spirit</i>;
by which we are to understand that she conversed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>Satan; who, that he might harden her the more in her sin, and
lead others, like Saul, into a credulous, diabolical presumption,
might reveal some secrets to her, and, at the same time, either
assume the shape, or, at least, counterfeit the voice of Samuel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus concerning those, who, by the practice of these arts,
have professed themselves to be in a kind of confederacy with
Satan. It is certain no good man ever practised them; and
therefore some have found it very difficult to understand the
sense of that scripture in Gen. xliv. 5. concerning the cup that
was in Benjamin’s sack; <i>Is not this the cup wherein my Lord
drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?</i> And Joseph himself
says, in ver. 15. <i>Wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly
divine?</i> Though Joseph was a prophet, it is certain he
was no diviner in that sense in which the word is commonly
used in scripture; nor was this cup an instrument by which he
practised any such art. Therefore, for the understanding of
this scripture, we may consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That the word which we render <i>to divine</i>, denotes, as it
is observed in the margin, to make trial of, or search after, or
to discover, or find out a matter; and instead of <i>whereby</i>, or
<i>by which</i>, it ought rather to have been rendered <i>concerning
which</i>; and then the meaning of the scripture is only this; <i>Is
not this the cup wherein my lord drinketh?</i> And therefore, if
it were lost or stolen, he would soon miss it; and make inquiry
to find out the thief, as he has now done. And when
Joseph says, ver. 15. <i>Wot ye not that such a man as I can
divine?</i> The meaning is, Do you think that one who is so
diligent and industrious in the management of all those affairs
that are incumbent on me, would lose the cup in which I drink,
and make no inquiry after it? Did you expect to go undiscovered,
when you had such an one as I to deal with, who
not only have an inclination, but all the advantages that can
be desired, to make search after those who have dealt unjustly
by me, as you have done?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d</i>, To <i>divine</i> may signify to <i>prophesy</i>; and so it may be
taken in a good sense as well as in a bad one. Accordingly,
when Joseph’s servants speak of him as divining concerning
the cup, they consider him as one who had an extraordinary
gift from God of revealing secrets. Therefore, they might
easily conclude that he would, by this means, find out the person
who had stolen his cup. This is agreeable to the Egyptian
mode of speaking; for those whom the Hebrews called
<i>prophets</i>, they called <i>diviners</i>. And Joseph used the same
expression when he says, <i>Wot you not that such a man as I
could divine?</i> that is, Did you not know that I was a prophet,
and by this means was advanced to my present honour in
Pharaoh’s court? So that, whether we take the words in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>or the other sense, it does not follow, that he used any arts
that were diabolical or unlawful.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now we are speaking concerning those arts, by which
Satan deludes them, who, either directly, or by consequence,
pay that regard to him which is due only to God. It may
farther be inquired; what we are to conclude concerning the
practice of judicial astrology, by those, who, in scripture, are
called <i>star-gazers</i>, as a term of contempt, whose profession is
universally condemned therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are, especially in our age, a generation of men, who
impose on the weakness of many superstitious and ignorant
people, who, by encouraging them, are partakers with them in
their sin. The art they pretend to, is not only uncertain, but
presumptuous, and contains in it a contempt of the providence
of God, in regarding the signs and intimations, which they
suppose they receive from the stars, concerning the future
contingent events, or those actions which take their rise from
the free-will of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which I would observe in general, concerning this
practice, is, that we no where find in scripture, that the stars
were designed to signify the prosperous or adverse circumstances
in which men shall be in the world; or to foretel the
riches or poverty, sickness or health, which we should experience
in our passage through it, or how long we shall continue
in it; our times and circumstances in the world being only in
God’s hand; and it is in mercy to us that he has concealed
these future events from us. To this we may add, that this
art, and those that use it, is very often spoken against in scripture,
and the church warned against it; when God says, <i>Learn
not the way of the Heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs
of heaven</i>, Jer. x. 2. And elsewhere, <i>Thou art wearied in the
multitude of thy counsels, let now the astrologers, the star-gazers,
the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee</i>,
Isa. xlvii. 13. And elsewhere, they are ranked with <i>diviners</i>,
and called <i>liars</i>, chap. xliv. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be inquired, Whether any good men have ever practised
this art, though without pretending to have had any intimation
from Satan, but only proceeding according to the rules
prescribed therein? It is not my business to censure men,
but things. Therefore the best that can be said thereof is;
that if any good men have studied or practised it, they have
generally blamed themselves for it afterwards, or, at least, confessed
the uncertainty and presumption thereof. And we read
of some that, in the time of their ignorance, had addicted
themselves thereunto; who, when it pleased God to convert
them, have laid it aside, and burned the books from whence
they learned it, Acts xix. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>It is objected against what has been said concerning the unlawfulness
of judicial astrology, that Moses addicted himself
to the study thereof, of whom it is said, That <i>he was learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians</i>, chap. vii. 22. To which
it may be replied, that if, by <i>the wisdom of the Egyptians</i>, we
understand, as most expositors do, judicial astrology, Moses
might know, but not approve of, or practise this art, which
was so much in use among the Egyptians. But it may be,
nothing more is intended by it, but his knowing the regular
motion of the stars, and the wisdom of God seen therein,
without judging of future events thereby; which is not only
lawful, but commendable: though, I am apt to think, that by
the <i>wisdom of the Egyptians</i>, we are to understand those
maxims of state, and the secrets of Pharaoh’s court, which he
had an opportunity to know, as being a great favourite with
him, as Josephus observes, who thinks that he designed that
he should succeed him in the throne<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c013'><sup>[207]</sup></a>. Thus having considered
this Commandment as being broken by Atheism and
idolatry, and the various kinds and degrees thereof; which is
called our having other gods;</p>

<p class='c006'>We proceed now to inquire what is meant by these words
[before me] in the first Commandment, which are an intimation
of the aggravation of the sins forbidden therein; whereby
God puts us in mind of his all-seeing eye, which ought to deter
us from the breach of it; especially when we consider, that
inasmuch as he beholds all our actions, he cannot but be exceedingly
displeased when we entertain any conceptions of him
that tend to question his authority, dethrone his sovereignty,
or alienate our affections from him, and set up any thing in
competition with him. And this should teach us how we
ought to set the Lord always before us, considering him as
the heart-searching God, who is jealous for his own honour,
and will not suffer this sin to go unpunished.</p>

that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span><span class='sc'>Quest. CVIII.</span> <i>What are the duties required in the second
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the second commandment are
the receiving, observing, and keeping pure and entire, all
such religious worship and ordinances as God hath instituted
in his word, particularly prayer and thanksgiving in the
name of Christ, the reading, preaching, and hearing of the
word, the administration and receiving of the sacraments,
church-government, and discipline, the ministry and maintenance
thereof, religious fasting, swearing by the name of
God, and vowing unto him. As also the disapproving, detesting,
opposing all false worship; and according to each
ones’ place and calling, removing it, and all monuments of
idolatry.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CIX.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the second Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the second Commandment, are,
all devising, counselling, commanding, using, and any ways
approving any religious worship not instituted by God himself,
tolerating a false religion, the making any representation
of God, of all, or of any of the three Persons, either
inwardly in our mind, or outwardly, in any kind of image
or likeness of any creature whatsoever, all worshipping of
it, or God, in it, or by it; the making of any representation
of feigned deities, and all worship of them, or service belonging
to them, all superstitious devices, corrupting the
worship of God, adding to it, taking from it, whether invented
and taken up of ourselves, or received by tradition
from others; though under the title of antiquity, custom,
devotion, good intent, or any other pretence whatsoever,
simony, sacrilege, all neglect, contempt, hindering and opposing
the worship and ordinances which God hath appointed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CX.</span> <i>What are the reasons annexed to the second Commandment
the more to enforce it?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The reasons annexed to the second Commandment,
the more to enforce it, contained in these words, [<i>For I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the
fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation,
of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my commandments</i>] are, besides
God’s sovereignty over us, and property in us, his fervent
zeal for his own worship, and his revengeful indignation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>against all false worship, as being a spiritual whoredom, accounting
the breakers of this commandment such as hate
him, and threatening to punish them unto divers generations,
and esteeming the observers of it, such as love him, and
keep his commandments, and promising mercy to them unto
many generations.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before we proceed to consider the subject-matter of
this Commandment, we shall premise something, in general,
concerning the difference between it, and the first Commandment.
The first Commandment respects the object of
worship; the second, the manner in which it is to be performed.
Accordingly the former forbids, our not owning God to
be such an one, as he has revealed himself to be, in his word;
as also the substituting any creature in his room, or acknowledging
it, either directly, or by consequence, to be our chief
good and happiness; the latter obliges us to worship this God,
in such a way as he has prescribed, in opposition to that,
which takes its rise from our own invention. These two
Commandments therefore being so distinct, we cannot but
think the Papists to be chargeable with a very great absurdity,
in making the second to be only an appendix to the first,
or an explication of it; the design whereof seems to be, that
they might exculpate themselves from the charge of idolatry,
in setting up image-worship, which they think to be no crime;
because they are not so stupid as to style the image a god, or
make it the supreme object of worship; whereas this Commandment,
forbidding false worship, is directly contrary to
their practice of worshipping God thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method, in which this Commandment is laid down, is
the same with that of several others, <i>viz.</i> as we have therein,
an account of the duties required, the sins forbidden, and the
reasons annexed to enforce it. We shall therefore</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Consider the duties commanded. These are contained
in two heads.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The obligation we are under to observe, or attend upon,
such religious worship and ordinances as God hath appointed.
Religious worship is that whereby we address ourselves to
God, as a God of infinite perfection; profess an entire subjection
and devotedness to him as our God; put our trust in
him for a supply of all our wants, and ascribe that praise and
glory, that is due to him, as our chief good, most bountiful
benefactor, and only portion and happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the ordinances, our attendance on them depends on
a divine command, to which God has annexed a promise of
his gracious presence, whereby our expectations are raised,
that we shall obtain some blessings from him, when we engage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>therein in a right manner, in which respect they are instituted
means of grace, and pledges of that special favour which he
designs to bestow on his people. This is that which more
especially renders a duty enjoined, an ordinance. Accordingly
our Saviour says, <i>Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the midst of them</i>, Matt.
xviii. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now these ordinances are either solitary or social; such as
we are obliged to perform in our closets, chap. vi. 6. in our
families; or in those public assemblies where God is worshipped.
These are particularly mentioned in this answer; and
they are prayer, thanksgiving, reading, preaching, and hearing
the word, the administration and receiving the sacraments; to
which we may add, praising God by singing; all which will
be insisted on in a following answer, and therefore we pass by
them at present, and shall only observe; that as these are duties
which are daily incumbent on us, so there are other duties
or ordinances, which are only to be performed as the necessity
of affairs require it; such as religious fasting, whereby
we express public tokens of mourning and humiliation, and
perform other duties agreeable thereunto, when God is provoked
by crying sins; or when his judgments are upon us, and
our families, or the church of God in general. Thus the
prophet Joel, when speaking concerning several desolating
judgments, which Israel was exposed to, commands them <i>to
sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly; and to weep between the
porch and the altar; and say, spare thy people, O Lord, and
give not thine heritage to reproach</i>, Joel ii. 15, 17. This is
not to be done at all times, but when the providence of God
calls for it. Therefore we have no warrant for the observation
of annual fasts; when that which was the first occasion
thereof, is removed; much less for those weeks of fasting
which the Papists observe, which they call Lent; for which,
no sufficient reason can be assigned why it should be observed
at that rather than any other time of the year. And their
fasting on certain days of the week cannot be vindicated; much
less their doing this without joining other religious duties to
it, or their abstaining from some kinds of food, while they
indulge themselves in eating others that are equally grateful
to the appetite; which is a ludicrous and superstitious way of
fasting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, another occasional duty or ordinance is, our setting
apart time for thanksgiving to God for deliverances from public
or national calamities, or those which more immediately
respect ourselves and families; in which those religious duties
are to be performed, that tend to express our spiritual joy and
thankfulness to God, who is the Author thereof, and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>same time, we are to pray, that he would enable us to walk
as such who are hereby laid under renewed engagements to
be his; thus the Jews observed some days of thanksgiving
for their deliverance from Haman’s conspiracy, Esth. ix. 20,
<i>&amp; seq.</i> And this is to be religiously observed, wherein it
differs from that carnal joy, which is generally expressed by
those who receive mercies, but do not give glory to God, the
sole Author thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, besides these occasional ordinances, there is
another mentioned in this answer, namely, vowing to God.
Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Vow, and pay unto the Lord</i>, Psal.
lxxvi. 11. which either, more especially, respects their entering
into a solemn obligation, or promise to give something that
was to be applied to the support of the public and costly-worship
which was performed under the ceremonial law; upon
which account it is said, in the following words, <i>Bring presents
unto him</i>; or it may be considered as to what concerns
the moral reason of the thing, as including in it our resolution
to set apart, or apply some portion of our worldly substance,
as God has prospered us in our secular affairs, to the maintaining
and promoting his cause and interest in the world.
And we ought, at the same time, to devote ourselves to him,
whereby we acknowledge his right to us, and all that we have.
Thus the apostle says, concerning the churches of Macedonia,
not only that they devoted their substance to God, but that
they <i>gave themselves</i>, also <i>unto the Lord</i>, 1 Cor. viii. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>This does not include in it our resolution to do those things
that are out of our own power; or, that we will exercise those
graces that are the special gift of the Spirit of God, but rather
a dedication of ourselves to him, in hope of obtaining that
grace from him which will enable us to perform those duties,
which are indispensably necessary to, and inseparably connected
with salvation. This is such a vowing to God, as will not
have a tendency to ensnare our own consciences, or detract
from his glory, who is alone the Author of all grace; nor does
it contain in it the least instance of presumption, but it is a
duty which we ought to perform by faith, to his glory and our
own edification.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we might add another ordinance, mentioned in
this answer; namely, swearing by the name of God; which,
as we have elsewhere expressed it, contains a swearing fealty
to him, and our consecrating and devoting ourselves to him<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c013'><sup>[208]</sup></a>.
And as to what respects swearing, as it is a religious duty to
be performed in subserviency to civil duties, we shall have
occasion to speak of that under the third Commandment; and
therefore we pass it over at present, and proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>2. That these, and all other religious duties or ordinances
which God has enjoined, are to be kept pure and entire. As
we are not to cast off the ordinances of God in general, so we
must take heed that we do not, while we perform some, live
in the neglect of others; for that is not to keep them entire.
Thus private duties are not to shut out those which are social
in our families or the public assemblies; nor entrench on that
time which ought to be allotted for them; and, on the other
hand, it is not sufficient for us to worship God in public, and,
at the same time, cast off all secret duties. This reproves the
practice of some modern enthusiasts, who pray not, unless
moved by the Spirit, as they pretend; and deny their obligation
to observe the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as we are to keep the ordinances of God entire,
we are also to keep them pure; that is, to allow of, or practise
nothing but what is warranted by the rules which God has
given us in his word, in opposition to those who corrupt his
worship, by intruding those ordinances into it which are of
their own invention; and pretending, that though God has not
commanded them, yet the service which we perform (which
can be no other than will-worship) will be acceptable to him.
This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider the sins forbidden in this Commandment.
The general scope and design hereof, as to what concerns the
negative part of it, is God’s prohibiting all false worship,
either in our hearts, outward actions or gestures, whereby we
adhere to our own imaginations rather than his revealed will;
which is the only rule of instituted worship. The things forbidden
in this commandment may be reduced to three heads;</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A not attending on the ordinances of God with that holy,
humble, and becoming frame of spirit, that the solemnity of
the duties themselves, or the authority of God enjoining, or
the advantages which we may expect to receive by them, call
for. When we do not seriously think what we are going about
before we engage in holy duties, or watch over our own hearts
and affections, or else worship God in a careless and indifferent
manner, in which case we may be said to draw nigh to him
with our lips, while our hearts are far from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We farther break this commandment, when we invent ordinances
which God has no where in his word commanded;
or think to recommend ourselves to him by such gestures, or
modes of worship, which we have no precedent or example
for in the New Testament; this is what is generally called
superstition and will-worship. Thus we read in the degenerate
age of the church, that <i>the statutes of Omri were kept,
and the works of the house of Ahab</i>, Micah vi. 16. as intimating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>that false worship which was practised by them. And
here we cannot but observe, that there are many things in
which the Papists are chargeable with superstition and will-worship,
if not with idolatry. As for instance,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Their worshipping the bread in the sacrament, as supposing
it to be the real body and blood of Christ, and not
barely the sign thereof; understanding the words of our Saviour,
in which, in instituting this ordinance, he says, <i>This is
my body</i>, Matt. xxvi. 26. in a literal sense; whereas it ought
to be taken in a figurative. Again,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Their lifting up the bread in the sacrament, pretending
that this is a real offering of Christ, and, at the same time, the
people being obliged to shew all possible marks of sorrow;
such as beating their breasts, shaking their heads, &amp;c. as
though they really saw Christ on the cross; whereas it is a
profaning the Lord’s supper, to say that Christ is really and
visibly offered therein by the hands of the priest; which is
contrary to what the apostle says of his being but <i>once offered
to bear the sins of many</i>, Heb. ix. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They use several superstitious ceremonies in baptism,
which have, indeed, a shew of religion, but want a divine
sanction, and are no other than an addition to Christ’s institution.
Thus they use spittle, salt, and cream, besides the water
with which the child is to be baptised, and anoint it with oil,
and use exorcism, commanding the unclean spirit to depart
out of it, and signing it with the sign of the cross; at which
they suppose the Devil to be so terrified, that he is hereby
obliged to leave it, being by this means, as it were, frighted
away. But the principal reason they give for their adding
this ceremony to Christ’s institution, is to signify that the child
is hereby obliged to fight manfully under Christ’s banner;
which obligation is neither increased nor diminished thereby;
and it is a sign which he makes no mention of.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Their frequent crossing of themselves, as a preservative
against sin, and a means to keep them from the power of
the Devil, and to render their prayers acceptable in the sight
of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) The splendor and magnificence of their churches, and
especially the shape and figure of them, as accommodated to
that of Solomon’s temple, and their situation east and west;
and also their bowing to the altar, which is placed in the east;
for which there is not the least shadow of argument in scripture,
nor example in the purest ages of the church.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) The ludicrous and unwarrantable ceremonies used in
the consecration of churches, and the reverence that every one
must shew to places thus consecrated, though it be not in the
divine worship. And to this we may add, that there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>many superstitious ceremonies in consecrating all the vessels
and utensils that are used in their churches; yea, the very
bells are baptised, or, as they express it, consecrated that so
the Devil may be afraid of the sound thereof, and keep his distance
from those places of worship in which they are fixed;
which charms can be reckoned no other than the sport of the
powers of darkness, or looked on by them with contempt.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) They ascribe a divine, yea, a meritorious virtue, to the
frequent repeating the Lord’s prayer in Latin, commonly called
<i>Pater noster</i>, and the angel’s salutation of the virgin Mary,
mentioned in Luke i. 28. called <i>Ave Maria</i>; which words they
put a corrupt sense upon, contrary to the proper meaning thereof;
which, if only recited, whether understood or no, it is reckoned
acceptable service.</p>

<p class='c006'>(8.) The distinction of garments, and the relative holiness
of persons that wear them as signified thereby. To which we
may add, the canonical hours which are appointed for the performing
divine service; especially if we consider the reason
which they allege for it, namely, because there was something
remarkable done or suffered by Christ, at those hours in the
day. These things argue them guilty of superstition.</p>

<p class='c006'>(9.) We might also take notice of the many things which
they make merchandise of, as consecrated bread, wax candles,
&amp;c. to which they ascribe a spiritual virtue, or some advantages
to be received hereby, by those that purchase them; which
tends to advance the price thereof. There are also the relicts
which they call the church’s treasure, or those rarities which
they purchase at a great rate; though some of the wiser Papists
have made but a jest of them. We pass by many other
superstitious ceremonies used by them, for brevity sake, and
shall only observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>(10.) Their bowing at the name of Jesus; which can hardly
be vindicated from the charge of superstition, especially because
no extraordinary instance of reverence is expressed at
the mention of those incommunicable attributes of God, which
are ascribed to him; nor, indeed, do they bow the knee at the
mentioning of the word Saviour, Christ, or Emmanuel, or when
any other divine characters are given him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only scripture they make use of to vindicate this practice,
is in Phil. ii. 10. <i>That at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow</i>; whereas it is plain, that this <i>bowing the knee</i> does
not signify a bodily gesture, but only a subjection of soul to
Christ, as <i>angels, authorities and powers are</i> said to be <i>made
subject to him</i>, 1 Pet. iii. 22. These, indeed, are a very considerable
part of the inhabitants of heaven, but they have no
knees to bow; and as for <i>things under the earth</i>, to wit, the
powers of darkness; they do not bow to him in a way of worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>but are subjected to him as conquered enemies. Which
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That they are guilty of the breach of this Commandment,
who frame an image of any of the persons of the Godhead, or
of any creature in heaven or earth, as a means or help made
use of in order to their worshipping God. Here it must be
enquired,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Whether the making images, absolutely, or in all respects,
be unlawful. To which it is generally answered, that
if pictures representing creatures, either in heaven or earth, be
made with no other design, but in an historical way, to propagate
the memory of persons, and their actions to posterity, it
seems not to be a breach of this Commandment. But the sin
forbidden therein, expressed in those words, <i>Making to ourselves
the image or likeness of creatures in heaven or earth</i>, is
when we design to worship God by them; and accordingly
the using bodily gestures to them, such as those which are
used in the worship of God; as bowing, uncovering the head,
&amp;c. wherein a person designs an act of worship, is idolatry.
And if nothing else is intended but the worshipping of God by
them, it can hardly be excused from the appearance of idolatry
at least; so that, according to one of the rules before laid
down for the understanding the Ten Commandments, it is to
be reckoned a breach of the second Commandment; which is
what we are now considering<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c013'><sup>[209]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It must farther be enquired, whether it be unlawful to
represent any of the persons in the Godhead, by pictures or
carved images? to this we answer, that God being infinite and
incomprehensible, it is impossible to frame any image like him,
Isa. xl. 18. chap. xlvi. 5. Acts xvii. 29. Moreover, he assigns
this as a reason why Israel should make no image of him, <i>because
they saw no manner of similitude when he spake to them
in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire</i>; and adds, <i>lest ye corrupt
yourselves, and make you a graven image</i>, Deut. iv. 15, 16.
And the apostle styles this an offering the highest affront to
God, when he speaks of some who <i>changed the glory of the incorruptible
God into an image made like to corruptible man</i>.
Rom. i. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are others, who, though they do not much care to defend
the practice of making pictures of God, yet plead for describing
an emblem of the Trinity, such as a triangle, with the
name Jehovah in the midst of it. But that which I would observe
concerning this practice is, that if the design hereof be
to worship God by it, it is idolatry; but if not, it is unwarrantable,
and, indeed, unnecessary; since a Trinity of persons in
the unity of the divine essence, is to be understood as revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>in scripture, and not brought to our remembrance by an
emblem, which is an ordinance of our own invention.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is farther enquired, whether we may not describe our Saviour,
as he sometimes is by the Papists, in those things that
respect his human nature? whether we may not pourtray him
as an infant in his mother’s arms; or, as conversing here on
earth, or hanging on the cross; as they not only describe him,
but adore this image or representation of Christ crucified,
which they call a crucifix? To this we answer; that whatever
of Christ comes within the reach of the art of man to delineate
or describe, is only his human nature, which is not the object
of divine adoration; and therefore this rather tends to debase
than give us raised and becoming conceptions of him as
such.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is argued by some, to prove that it is not unlawful
to make an image of God, inasmuch as he is sometimes
represented as having a body, or bodily parts; and the prophet
Daniel describes God the Father, as <i>the ancient of days</i>,
Dan. vii. 9. therefore, they suppose, that it is not unlawful for
them to make such representations of him by images. To this
it may be answered, that God’s being described by the parts
of human bodies, is in condescension to the weakness of our
capacities, or agreeable to human modes of speaking; in which
<i>the eye</i> signifies wisdom, <i>the arm</i> power, <i>the heart</i> love, &amp;c.
We are, notwithstanding those modes of expression, to abstract
in our thoughts, every thing that is carnal, or applicable to the
creature when conceiving of him, and therefore not to give occasion
to any to think that he is like ourselves, by describing
him in such a way. The Papists not only plead for making
such like images, but set them up in churches, calling them the
laymen’s books, with a design to instruct them in those things
which the image represents. To which it may be replied, that
such a method of instruction is without any warrant from scripture,
as well as contrary to the practice of the purest ages of
the church, who always thought that the word of God was sufficient
to lead them into the knowledge of himself, without making
use of a picture to that end.</p>

<p class='c006'>But notwithstanding this colour is put on their practice, of
setting up such-like images in churches; yet there are some
who plead for the worship of images, only with this distinction,
that it is a subordinate or a relative worship that they give to
them, while, at the same time, the highest worship is given to
God only; in which respect they cannot exculpate themselves
from the charge of idolatry. And, indeed, in some of their
books of devotion, we find the same expressions used, when
they address themselves to the creature, as though they were
paying divine adoration to God; particularly in the book, that
is well known among them, called the <i>Virgin Mary’s Psalter</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>in which her name is often inserted instead of the name of God,
which is the highest strain of blasphemy. Thus when it is said,
<i>O come let us kneel before the Lord our Maker</i>, Psal. xcv. 6.
instead of <i>the Lord</i>, they put the <i>Virgin Mary</i>. And when it
is said, <i>Have mercy upon me, O God</i>, &amp;c. Psal. li. 1. they pray,
<i>Have mercy upon me, O Lady</i>, &amp;c. which expressions cannot
be read without detestation. And there are many more to the
like purpose, in that book.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this has been objected against them as a specimen of
their idolatry, all the reply they make to it is; that the book
was written by a private person, as an help to devotion, but
not established by the authority of the church, which is not to
be charged with every absurdity which some of their communion
may advance. To which it may be replied, that the
church of Rome has been very ready to condemn better books,
written by those who were not in their communion; whereas
they never publicly condemned this book, but rather commended
it, as written with a good design.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides we may farther observe, that there are many blasphemous
expressions given to the virgin Mary, in their Breviaries
and Missals, which are used by public authority. Thus
she is often addressed to in such characters as these, viz. the
mother of mercy, the gate of heaven, the queen of heaven, the
empress of the world; and sometimes she is desired not only
to pray her son to help them, but, by the authority of a mother,
to command him to do it. At other times they desire her
to help and save them herself; and accordingly they give her
the title of Redeemer, and Saviour, as well as our Lord Jesus
Christ. And sometimes they profess themselves to put their
trust and confidence in her. If this be not idolatry, where is
there any to be found in the world?</p>

<p class='c006'>To this we may also add, that idolatry which is practised by
them in their devotion, to the images of other saints. Every
saint in their Kalendar is called upon, in his turn; among
whom some indeed were good men, as the martyrs, who refused
to be worshipped while on earth; how much soever these
worship them now they are in heaven. But there are others
whom the Popes have canonized for saints, who were little better
than devils incarnate, while they were here upon earth;
and others have been rebels and traitors to their king and country,
and suffered the just reward of their wickedness; such as
these are found among those whom they pay this worship to.
There are also others whom they worshipped as saints; concerning
whom it may be much questioned whether there ever
were such persons in the world; these may be called fabulous
saints. Nevertheless, images are made to their honour, and
prayers directed to them. And there are other things worshipped
by them, which never had life, as the picture of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>cross, and many pretended relics of the saints. So that upon
the whole, we cannot but think that we have, in this mode of
worship, a notorious instance of the breach of this Commandment.
And we cannot but conclude, that herein they have apostatized,
or turned aside from the purity of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be observed, that the church, for the first three hundred
years after Christ, had comparatively, but little superstition,
and no idolatry; but in the fourth Century, superstition
began to insinuate itself into it; then it was that the pictures
of the martyrs, who had suffered in Christ’s cause, were first
set up in churches, though without any design of worshipping
them; and this was not universally approved of. As for
image-worship, it was not brought into the church till above
seven hundred years after Christ; and then there was a considerable
opposition made to it by some; and this kind of worship
was set up in one reign, and prohibited in another; but
afterwards it universally prevailed in the Romish church, when
arrived to that height of impiety and idolatry, without opposition,
as it is at this day. We now proceed to observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The reasons annexed to this Commandment, which are
taken from the consideration of what God is in himself; <i>I am
the Lord</i>, or <i>Jehovah</i>; which being a name never given to any
creature, is expressive of all his divine perfections, which render
him the object of worship, and oblige us to perform that
worship which he requires, in such a way as is agreeable thereunto;
he also styles himself a God to his people, <i>I am thy God</i>;
therefore to set up strange gods, or to worship him in a way
not prescribed by him, is a violation of his covenant, as well
as not performing the duty we owe to him, and would render
us unfit to be owned by him as his people. And it is farther
observed, that they who thus corrupt themselves, and pervert
his worship, are styled haters of him, and therefore can expect
nothing but to be dealt with as enemies. This he gives them
to understand, inasmuch as he styles himself <i>a jealous</i>, or sin-revenging
<i>God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children</i>. For the understanding of which, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That though God does not punish children with eternal
destruction, for the sins of their immediate parents, yet these
oftentimes bring temporal judgments on families. Thus, all
the children of Israel that murmured and despised the good
land, so far bare their fathers iniquity, that they wandered in
the wilderness near forty years.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. These judgments fall heavier on those children that make
their parents sins their own; which was the case of the Jews.
Upon which occasion our Saviour tells them, that <i>all the blood
that was shed upon the earth, should come upon them, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, whom they
slew between the temple and the altar</i>, Matt, xxiii. 35. They
approved of, and committed the same sins which their fathers
were guilty of, and consequently are said to fill up the measure
of their sins; therefore the judgments of God, which they exposed
themselves to, were most terrible.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Whatever temporal judgments may be inflicted on children
for their parents sins, shall be sanctified, and redound to
their spiritual advantage, as well as end in their everlasting
happiness, if they do not follow their bad example; and therefore
it is farther observed, that God <i>shews mercy unto thousands
of them that love him, and keep his Commandments</i>.
These are very great motives and inducements to enforce the
observation of all God’s Commandments, and this in particular.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXI., CXII., CXIII., CXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXI.</span> <i>Which is the third Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The third Commandment is, <i>Thou shalt not take the
name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold
him guiltless, that taketh his name in vain</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXII.</span> <i>What is required in the third Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The third Commandment requires, that the name of
God, his titles, attributes, ordinances, the word, sacraments,
prayer, oaths, vows, lots, his works, and whatsoever else
there is whereby he makes himself known, be holily and
reverently used in thought, meditation, word, writing, by an
holy profession, and answerable conversation, to the glory
of God, and the good of ourselves and others.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXIII.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the third Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the third Commandment are,
the not using of God’s name as is required, and the abuse
of it, in an ignorant, vain, irreverent, profane, superstitious,
or wicked mentioning or otherwise using his titles, attributes,
ordinances, or works; by blasphemy, perjury; all
sinful cursings, oaths, vows, and lots; violating of our oaths,
and vows, if lawful, and fulfilling them, if of things unlawful,
murmuring and quarrelling at, curious prying into, and
misapplying of God’s decrees, and providences, misinterpreting,
misapplying, or any way perverting the word, or
any part of it, to profane jests, curious or unprofitable questions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>vain janglings, or the maintaining of false doctrines,
abusing it, the creatures, or any thing contained under the
name of God, to charms, or sinful lusts and practices, the
maligning, scorning, reviling, or any ways opposing of God’s
truth, grace, and ways, making profession of religion in
hypocrisy, or for sinister ends; being ashamed of it, or a
shame to it, by uncomfortable, unwise, unfruitful, and offensive
walkings, or backslidings from it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXIV.</span> <i>What are the reasons annexed to the third
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The reasons annexed to the third Commandment in
these words [<i>the Lord thy God</i>] and [<i>for the Lord will not
hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain</i>] are, because,
he is the Lord and our God, and therefore his name is not
to be profaned, or any way abused by us, especially, because
he is so far from acquitting and sparing the transgressors of
this Commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape
his righteous judgment, albeit, many such escape the censures
and punishments of men.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the second Commandment respects the manner in which
God is to be worshipped, agreeably to his revealed will;
in this we are commanded to worship him with that frame of
spirit which is suitable to the greatness of the work, and the
Majesty of him with whom we have to do. By the name of
God we are to understand all those things whereby he is pleased
to make himself known; and these are his names, titles,
attributes, words and works. The attributes of God have
been largely insisted on in that question, <i>What is God<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c013'><sup>[210]</sup></a>?</i> His
names and titles have also been considered, as belonging to
all the persons of the Godhead, in proving that the Son and
Holy Ghost are God equal with the Father<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c013'><sup>[211]</sup></a>. His word is
that in which the glory that is contained in his names, titles
and attributes, is set forth in the most glorious manner. Thus
the Psalmist says; <i>Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy
name</i>, Psal. cxxxviii. 2. or, thou hast given a brighter discovery
of thyself in thy word, than thou hast done in any thing
else, by which thou hast made thyself known to thy creatures.
And as for the works of God, whether of nature or of grace,
these are designed to lead us into the knowledge of his power,
wisdom, goodness, holiness and faithfulness, which are eminently
glorified in all that he does. Now this Commandment
respects our having a due regard to all those ways whereby
he makes himself known, and contains a prohibition of every
thing that may tend to cast the least dishonour upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>The method in which we are led to speak to it, is to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What is required in it. This supposes, that it is an indispensible
duty for us to make mention of the name of God.
Since he has given us some discoveries of himself, by what
means soever he has done it, it would be an instance of the
highest contempt of the greatest privilege, for us to express
no regard to them; which they may be said practically to do,
who make no profession of religion, and desire not to be instructed
in those things which relate to the name and glory of
God; which argues a person to be abandoned to the greatest
wickedness, and to live without God in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are several duties mentioned in this answer, in
which we are said to make use of God’s name; particularly,
when we attend on his ordinances, viz. the word, sacraments
and prayer; and take religious oaths, and make solemn vows;
which, doubtless, are to be performed with the utmost reverence.
We have many instances, in scripture, of holy men
who, when they have drawn nigh to him in prayer, have adored
his divine perfections, with a becoming humility. Thus
Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, addresses himself to
God; <i>There is no god like thee, in heaven above, or on earth
beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants,
that walk before thee with all their heart</i>, 1 Kings viii. 23.
And Jacob, when wrestling with God in prayer, says, <i>O God
of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord
which saidst unto me, Return to thine own country, and to thy
kindred, and I will deal well with thee. I am not worthy of the
least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast
shewed unto thy servant</i>, Gen. xxxii. 9, 10. And Hezekiah
expresses himself thus in prayer, <i>O Lord God of Israel, which
dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou
alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven
and earth</i>, 2 Kings xix. 25. And Daniel in prayer, styles
him, <i>The great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant, and
mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments</i>,
Dan. ix. 4. And Abraham, when standing before
the Lord, and pleading in behalf of Sodom, says, <i>Behold,
now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am
but dust and ashes</i>, Gen. xviii. 27. And the inhabitants of
heaven, who are nearest the throne of God, are represented as
worshipping him with the greatest reverence, <i>casting their
crowns before the throne</i>, in token of their being unworthy of
the honour that they are advanced to, and saying, <i>Thou art
worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour and power</i>, Rev.
iv. 10, 11. which is to be understood of him, exclusive of all
others. And as this reverence is to be expressed when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>ask any thing at the hand of God, by a parity of reason, it
ought to expressed in any other religious duty, on which he
has made, some impressions of his glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be enquired, whether this reverence is consistent with
that boldness which believers are said to have in prayer, when
they are exhorted to <i>come boldly unto the throne of grace</i>, Heb.
iv. 16. and to <i>have boldness to enter into the holiest of all, by
the blood of Jesus</i>, chap. x. To this it may be answered, that
the word there used<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c013'><sup>[212]</sup></a>, which is called boldness, may be rendered
a liberty of speech. So that though he be infinitely
above us, and a God of infinite holiness and purity, and therefore
has the utmost abhorrence of sin, which we have reason
to charge ourselves with, yet we are encouraged to come to
him, as sitting on a throne of grace: from whence he displays
his glory, as a sin-pardoning God, who otherwise appears in
his jealousy, as a sin-revenging Judge. Therefore this <i>boldness</i>
is nothing else but our making use of that liberty which
God gives us to come into his presence with hope of being accepted
in his sight, in and through a Mediator.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might farther observe, that as we are to express an
holy reverence, in drawing nigh to God, in all religious duties;
so we ought not to think of any of his works, but with a due
regard to, and the highest veneration of, his glory shining
forth therein. Thus it is said, <i>Remember that thou magnify
his work, which men behold</i>, Job xxxvi. 24. and this reverence
is to be expressed in our meditations, words and writings; so
that we should never think or treat of divine subjects, but in
an holy manner; we should never speak of any thing, by which
God manifests his glory, but with a design to beget in ourselves
and others, a reverential fear of, and the highest esteem
for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider the sins forbidden in this Commandment;
and accordingly, we violate it by not using the
name of God in such a way as it is required. This includes
in it,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The not making any profession of religion, as being afraid
or ashamed to own, that in which the name of God is so much
concerned. Persons, indeed, do not usually arrive to this
height of wickedness at once; but the mind is alienated from
God, and his worship, by degrees. There is first a great deal
of lukewarmness, formality, and hypocrisy, reigning in the
heart of man; so that if they attend on the ordinances of God’s
worship, it is with great indifferency, many prejudices entertained
against them, and with such a frame of spirit as savours
more profaneness than true religion. After this they are
ashamed of Christ and his cause, being influenced by the reproach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>that is cast on it in the world. Thus the Jews pretended,
concerning Christianity, that it was <i>a sect every where
spoken against</i>, Acts xxviii. 22. And Demas forsook the
apostle, <i>having loved this present world</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 10. being
more concerned for his reputation in it, than for Christ’s interest.
After this, such cast off all public worship; and this
is generally attended with a seared conscience, and running
into all excess of riot.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Persons take the name of God in vain, when though they
make a profession of religion, yet it is not in such a way as
God has required; and this is done by using his titles, attributes,
or any ordinances or works, in which he makes himself
known in an unbecoming manner; with ignorance, when we
speak of the divine perfections, and, at the same time, have
no just ideas of what is intended thereby; or when we use the
name of God with a vanity or levity of spirit, and mention
sacred things in a common way, whereby we may be said to
profane them; or when we superstitiously pay a kind of veneration
to the sound of words, relating to divine matters, but
regard not the thing signified thereby. This is using the name
of God in such a way as he has not required, and consequently
taking it in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The name of God is taken in vain by blasphemy; which
is a thinking or speaking reproachfully of him, as though he
had no right to the glory that belongs to his name; which is,
in effect, a cursing him in our hearts, and offering the greatest
injury that can be done, to a God of infinite perfection; which,
though it be no real lessening his essential glory, yet it argues
the greatest malignity, and highest degree of impiety in those
that are guilty of it. This was so great a crime, that, by
God’s command, it was punished with death, Lev. xxiv. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. This Commandment is broken by not using religious
oaths in a right manner, or by violating them; and, on the
other hand, by all sinful and profane oaths and cursing.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) By not using religious oaths in a right manner. It is
certain, that we are, upon extraordinary occasions, to make
mention of the name of God, by solemn oaths, in which we
appeal to him as a God of truth, the searcher of hearts, and
the avenger of falsehood. That this is a duty, appears,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] In that we have various instances, in scripture, of God’s
condescending to confirm what he has spoken, by an oath;
wherein he appeals to his own perfections for the confirmation
of our faith. Thus he is represented as <i>swearing by himself</i>,
and by <i>his holiness</i>, Gen. xxii. 16, 17. Psal. lxxxix. 35.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] There are several examples and commands, in scripture,
which make it our duty to appeal to God, on some occasions,
by solemn oaths. Thus it is said, <i>Thou shalt fear the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name</i>, Deut. vi.
13. And elsewhere, <i>To me every knee shall bow, and every
tongue shall swear</i>, Isa. xlv. 23. But we must observe that
there is a vast difference between God’s swearing by himself,
or by any of his perfections, and man’s swearing by him.
When God swears by himself, it is a display of the glory of
his perfections, as a God that cannot lye; but when man swears
by him, it is an act of religious worship, containing an acknowledgment
of his perfections, and an appeal to him, as a God of
truth, and the avenger of a lye. Therefore an oath is not to
be taken, but in matters of great importance, which cannot be
decided without it; and being an act of religious worship, it
ought to be performed in the most solemn manner; otherwise
we profane the name of God, and so violate this commandment.
This respects not so much the form used in swearing,
as the levity of spirit with which it is done, or our pretending
to confirm that which is false hereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>The form used in solemn oaths has been various.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We read of some ceremonies used in swearing, that
were only occasional. Thus when Jacob and Laban took a
solemn oath to each other, at their parting, a <i>pillar was erected</i>,
and a <i>heap of stones</i> gathered together, and they both eat
upon the heaps and <i>sware by the God of Abraham and Nahor,
and the fear of Isaac, that they would do no injury to each
other</i>, Gen. xxxi. 45,-53. Also we read, that when Abraham
made his servant swear, that he would take a wife for
Isaac, from among his kindred, and not out of the land where
he dwelt, he ordered him to <i>put his hand under his thigh</i>,
chap. xxiv. 2, 3, 4. This form of swearing seemed to be an
appeal to God, as having promised that his seed should be increased
and multiplied, and that in his seed, all the families of
the earth should be blessed; which was a circumstance well
adapted to the matter and occasion of the oath, viz. that he
should provide such a wife for Isaac as God approved of.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The common form of swearing used of old, seems to
have been by <i>lifting up the hand</i> to heaven, thereby signifying
their appeal to God, whose throne is there; accordingly the
<i>lifting up the hand to heaven</i> imports the same thing as to
swear, according to the scripture-mode of speaking, Deut.
xxxii. 40. In this manner Abraham sware, Gen. xiv. 22, 23.
and the angel which appeared to John, Rev. x. 5. and this is
undoubtedly, a very good and justifiable form of swearing;
and it is used, in some Protestant countries, even at this day.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the form used by us in public solemn oaths, viz. laying
the hand on the Bible, or on the gospels, and kissing the
book, it is no where warranted by scripture, and therefore is
not so eligible as that lifting up the hand; yet because it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>the common legal form used among us, it is rather to be complied
with, than that the duty should be neglected; because,
as has been but now observed, some forms of swearing are
said to have been used in scripture, and not reproved, which
were of men’s invention. And the thing principally to be
looked at in an oath, is, the solemn appeal made therein to
God. Therefore it is the frame of spirit with which this is
done, that is chiefly to be regarded. And what we have promised
to do, is religiously to be observed, that so our oaths
may not be violated.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> The objections against the use of religious oaths, are
principally taken from two or three scriptures, not rightly understood,
in which they seem to be forbidden; as when our
Saviour says, <i>I say unto you, Swear not at all</i>, Matt. v. 34.
and in James v. 12. the apostle speaks to the same purpose;
and it is farther objected, that the prophet speaks of this as a
national sin; when he says, <i>Because of swearing the land
mourneth</i>, Jer. xxiii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In these scriptures profane swearing is forbidden;
whereby persons make use of the name of God to confirm
what they say, in a light and trifling manner; or swearing by
creatures, as the heaven, the earth, or any creature therein.
But they do not forbid swearing, as containing in it a religious
appeal unto God in a solemn manner, for the confirming of
what we assert. And when the prophet speaks of the <i>land’s
mourning because of swearing</i>, it may be rendered, as in the
margin of our Bibles; <i>because of cursing the land mourneth</i>,
intimating, that it was a custom among them, to imprecate the
wrath of God against one another; which was a sin highly
provoked to the Majesty of heaven. And, besides, it appears
that the prophet is speaking of profane cursing or swearing, by
what is said in the words immediately following; <i>for both
prophet and priest are profane</i>. So that people of all ranks
and degrees, were profane; the prophets and priests by abusing
the sacred mysteries; and the people, in their common
discourse, using oaths and curses; for which things the land
mourned. This is the plain sense of that scripture; and therefore
no arguments can be drawn from thence to prove that
solemn and religious oaths are unlawful.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is, indeed, unlawful to swear by creatures, as is observed
in the scriptures but now mentioned; for they are not omniscient,
and therefore not to be appealed to for the decided matters,
which are known to none but ourselves, and the Searcher
of hearts; neither are they to be reckoned avengers of the
cause of injured truth; for they have not a sovereignty over
man, or a right to judge and punish them in such a way as
God has; for that belongs only to him, and therefore to swear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>by their name, is to give them a branch of his glory, and consequently
to take his name in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) This Commandment is broken by violating religious
oaths, both those that are assertory or promissory. Therefore,
when men assert that, for truth, which is uncertain; or,
especially if they know it to be false, and so design to deceive,
they break this Commandment. As for promissory oaths,
they contain an appeal to God concerning what respects some
things to be done by us, conducive to the good of others. Now
we are guilty of the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When we assert a thing, without implying this condition
that ought to be contained in it, if God will, or he be
pleased to enable us to do it. This the apostle particularly
mentions, when he blames those who say, <i>To day or to morrow
we will go to such a city, and continue there a year, and
buy, and sell, and get gain. Whereas they know not what shall
be on the morrow.</i> And therefore, they <i>ought to say, If the
Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that</i>, James iv. 13, 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When we promise a thing, that is out of our power to
perform; and, much more, when we do not design to perform
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When we promise a thing, which is in itself unlawful;
as the Jews did, who <i>bound themselves under a curse, that they
would not eat nor drink till they had killed Paul</i>, Acts xxiii,
12. If we have obliged ourselves by an oath, to perform that
which is unlawful, as we sin in making, we should do so in
fulfilling it. There are, however, some cases in which persons
may not perform what they have sworn to do, and yet not be
guilty of perjury, or violation of their oaths; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When they have used their utmost endeavours to fulfil
what they have promised to do, but yet cannot accomplish it.
Though here it must be observed, that if the thing promised
was absolutely out of their power when the promise was made,
the oath (as we but now observed) was unlawful. But supposing
the thing was in their power when they promised it;
but an unforeseen providence has put it out of their power at
present, though they have used their utmost endeavours to
perform it, they are not chargeable with the guilt of perjury.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, If we have promised to do a thing that is for the advantage
of another; but now see reason to alter our mind, apprehending
some detriment will accrue thereby to ourselves;
we must, notwithstanding, fulfil our promise. Thus the
Psalmist says, <i>he sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not</i>,
Psal. xxv. 4. However, if the person to whom we have made
the promise, who is to receive the advantage by our fulfilling
it, is willing to discharge us from our obligation, we may
omit to do it, and not be guilty of perjury.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>Here it might be enquired; whether we are always obliged
to fulfil a promise extorted from us by violence? In answer
to which, it is generally supposed, by divines, that we are not.
Nevertheless, the person can hardly be excused from sin in
snaking such a promise, when he designs not to perform it,
though some small degree of force or threatening were used;
especially since the will cannot be obliged to consent, or the
tongue to utter the promise. And to all this we may add,
that they are guilty of the breach of this Commandment (how
much soever they may think themselves guiltless) who use
equivocations, or mental reservations, in taking solemn and
religious oaths. Thus the Papists make no scruple of swearing
to support the government under which they live, and yet
take the first opportunity that offers to subvert it, pretending
they swore to support it as it stood before the reformation;
or when they swear allegiance to their sovereign, and yet do
what they can to dethrone him; and have this mental reservation,
that they intended only to do it for the present, till they
have a convenient opportunity to join in a successful rebellion.
By this means they break through the solemn tie of religious
oaths, elude the law, and impose upon the common sense of
mankind, in such a way, as even the Heathen themselves are
afraid and ashamed to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) This farther leads us to consider this Commandment
as broken by swearing profanely; namely, when we make use
of the name of God, and pretend to confirm what we assert
by an appeal to him, and, at the same time, are far from doing
this in a religious manner. This many do, who give vent to
their passions by profane swearing, by invoking the name of
God upon light and trifling occasions, without that due regard
that ought always to be paid to his divine Majesty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under this head we may observe, that cursing is a vile sin,
whether a man imprecates the wrath of God on himself or
others. They who curse themselves, do, in effect, pray that
God would hasten their everlasting destruction; as though
their damnation slumbered, or as if it were a thing to be wished
for. These do that which the devils themselves would not
venture to do. And to curse others is to put up a profane
wicked prayer to God, to pour out his vengeance upon them,
which is the highest affront to him; as though the vials of his
wrath were to be emptied on men, when they pleased, to satisfy
their passionate revenge against them. This also includes
in it a vile instance of uncharitableness, towards those whom
we are commanded to love as ourselves, Matt. xxii. 39. And
how contrary is it to that golden rule laid down by our Saviour,
<i>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
ye even so to them?</i> chap. xvii. 12. Thus we are said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>break this Commandment by perjury or profane swearing.
And to this we may add, that it is notoriously broken by sinful
vows; either when we resolve, or determine, to do what
is unlawful, or bring ourselves under solemn engagements, to
do that which is lawful, to our own strength, without dependance
on the grace of God in Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) It is farther observed in this answer, that men take the
name of God in vain, by sinful lots; but this is to be farther
explained. Therefore let it be considered; That when lots
were an ordinance by which God, in an extraordinary manner,
determined things that were before unknown; they being an
instituted means of appealing to him for that end; as in the
case of Achan and others, Josh. vii. 13, 14. Acts i. 26. then
lots were not to be used in a common way, for that would
have been a profaning a sacred institution. But since this extraordinary
ordinance is now ceased, it does not seem unlawful,
so as to be an instance of profaneness, to make use of lots
in civil matters; <a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c013'><sup>[213]</sup></a> provided we do not consider them as an
ordinance which God has appointed, in which we think we
have ground to expect his immediate interposure; and to depend
upon it as though it were a divine oracle. In this view
it would be unlawful at present, to use lots in any respect
whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Persons are said to break this Commandment by murmuring,
quarrelling at, curiously prying into, and misapplying
God’s decrees or providences, or perverting what he has revealed
in his word, <i>i. e.</i> when we apply things sacred to profane
uses, and have not a due regard to the glory of God,
which is contained therein; when we pervert scripture, by
making use of those sacred expressions that are contained
therein, in our common discourse, as some make the scripture
the subject of their profane wit and drollery. This is certainly
a taking God’s name in vain. And, it is farther added, that
we do so, by maintaining false doctrines, <i>i. e.</i> when we pretend,
that such a doctrine is from God, when it is not, or that he
makes himself known hereby; when the doctrine is altogether
disowned by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) This Commandment is farther broken, by making use
of God’s name as a charm; as when the writing, or pronouncing
some name of God, is pretended to be an expedient to heal
diseases, or drive away evil spirits; which is a great instance
of profaneness, and that which he abhors.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) This Commandment is farther broken, by reviling or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>opposing God’s truth, grace, and ways; whereby we cast contempt
on that which is most sacred, and lightly esteemed that
which he sets such a value on, and makes himself known by.
To this we may add, that this is done by hypocrisy, and sinister
ends in religion, whereby we walk, so that we are an offence
to others, and backslide from the ways of God. This is an
abuse of that which ought to be our glory, and a disregarding
that, whereby God manifests his name and glory to the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are now to consider the reasons annexed to the
third Commandment. And these are taken,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. From the consideration of what God is in Himself, as he
is the Lord, whose name alone is Jehovah; whereby he puts
us in mind of his sovereignty over us, and his undoubted right
to obedience from us; and hereby intimates that his excellency
should fill us with the greatest reverence and humility, when
we think or speak of any thing, by which he makes himself
known. Moreover, he reveals himself to his people as their
God, that so his greatness should not confound us, or his
dread, as an absolute God, whom we have offended, make us
despair of being accepted in his sight. Therefore we are to
look upon him as our reconciled God and Father in Christ;
which is the highest motive to obedience.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The observation of this Commandment is farther enforced,
by a threatening denounced against those that break it;
concerning whom it is said, That the Lord will not hold him
guiltless that taketh his name in vain. This implies that there
will be a judgment, a reckoning day, when all shall be called
to an account; and it shall be known whether they are guilty
or not guilty. It is farther observed, that the profaning of
God’s name is a sin that carries in it a great weight of guilt,
and renders the sinner liable to punishment, in proportion
thereunto; and accordingly God is said not to hold them guiltless,
or that they shall not escape the punishment from him;
though they may, and often do, escape punishment from men.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are many instances of the profanation of the name
of God, which no laws of man can reach. As when we
attend on his ordinances without that inward purity of
heart, and those high and becoming thoughts of him, which
we ought always to entertain. On the other hand, human
laws against open profaning the name of God, are not severe
enough to deter men from it; and if they are, they are seldom
put in execution; which is one reason why we behold the
name of God so openly blasphemed, and yet this iniquity go
unpunished from men. Nevertheless, such are to expect that
God will follow them with the tokens of his displeasure, sometimes
with temporal, at other times with spiritual judgments.
And this is assigned as a reason why we ought to make mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>of the name of God, or of every thing whereby he makes
himself known, in such a way, as that we may glorify him
thereby.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXV., CXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> CXV. <i>Which is the fourth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The fourth Commandment is, <i>Remember the Sabbath
day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all
thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,
nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> CXVI. <i>What is required in the fourth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The fourth Commandment requireth of all men, the
sanctifying, or keeping holy to God, such set time as he
hath appointed in his word; expressly, one whole day in
seven, which was the seventh from the beginning of the
world to the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the
week ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world;
which is the Christian Sabbath, and in the New Testament,
called the Lord’s day.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this Commandment it is supposed, that God is the sovereign
Lord of our time; which is to be improved by us,
to the best purposes, as he shall direct. And, inasmuch as
there are some special reasons which he has appointed for the
exercise of religious worship, these are called <i>holy days</i>, and
as we are to abstain from our secular employments therein,
while engaging in religious duties, they are called <i>sabbaths</i>; and
that more especially, because they are sanctified, by God, for
his service. These are considered more generally, as including
in them all those set times which God has appointed in his
word, which is contained in the moral reason of this Commandment;
and therefore, if he was pleased to institute, as he
did under the ceremonial law, various Sabbaths, or days appointed
for rest, and the performance of religious worship, his
people are obliged to observe them. And therefore, I take
the meaning of this commandment to be, Remember a sabbath
day, or every sabbath day, or every day which God hath
sanctified for that end, to keep it holy; and then follows the
particular intimation of the weekly sabbath. This, as is observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>in the answer we are explaining, was the seventh day
of the week, from the beginning of the world, to the resurrection
of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since; which
is the Christian Sabbath, and, in the New Testament, is called
the Lord’s day. In considering the subject-matter of this
Commandment, we must</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Inquire, since it is contained in the decalogue, which is
an abstract of the moral law; whether we are obliged to observe
the Sabbath by the law of nature, or by some positive
law. For the understanding of which, let it be premised, that
some laws are moral by way of eminency, or, in the highest
sense, as distinguished from all positive law; and others we
may call moral-positive, that is, the laws are positive; but yet
there is some moral reason annexed to enforce our obedience
to them. And this moral reason is either what is founded in
the sovereignty of God commanding, which takes place in all
positive laws, which, in this respect, are moral, though they
could not be known without a divine revelation; or else positive
laws may have a moral circumstance annexed to them, to
engage us to obedience, taken from some glory that redounds
to God, or good to ourselves, by the observation thereof; or
from some other reason which God annexes to them. As for
instance, the reason annexed to the fourth Commandment, is
taken from God’s resting from the work of creation on the
seventh day, and its being sanctified for our performing religious
duties therein. Here we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In what respects the Sabbath is moral in the highest and
most proper sense of the word, as before mentioned. That
this may appear, we shall lay down the following propositions,
which may be considered in their respective connexion.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is a branch of the moral law, that God should be
worshipped. This is founded in his divine perfections, in the
relation we stand in to him, and in the consideration of our
being intelligent creatures, capable of worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The moral law obliges us to perform social worship.
This appears from hence, that man, as a creature, is capable
of society, and naturally inclined and disposed to it: which we
cannot but know, when we look into ourselves, and consider
the disposition of all intelligent creatures, leading them together
with ourselves, to this end; so that without any positive
law to direct us, we should be naturally inclined to converse
with one another.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) As man is a creature designed to worship God, as the
law of nature suggests, so it appears, from the same law, that
he is obliged to perform social worship. For if we are obliged
to converse with one another, and thereby to be helpful to
each other, in other respects; certainly we are obliged, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>same law to converse with one another therein, and to express
our united concurrence in those things that relate to the glory
of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The law of nature farther suggests, that as the whole
of our business, in this world, is not included in that of society,
which is rather to be occasional than stated; and there are
other secular employments, which we are to be engaged in, in
which we do not converse with others; so we are not to spend
our whole time in public or social worship. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) It follows from hence, that some stated times are to be
appointed for this end; and it is agreeable to the law of nature,
that God, who is the sovereign Lord of our time, as well as
the object of social worship, should appoint these times; that
is, that he should ordain a Sabbath, or what proportion of
time he pleases, for us to perform those religious duties which
he enjoins, therein. These considerations, relating to our observation
of the Sabbath, are purely moral, and not positive.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall shew in what respects the Sabbath is positive,
and not moral in the highest and most propense sense of the
word. Here let it be considered, that it is the result of a positive
law, that one proportion of time should be observed for
a Sabbath, rather than another; namely, that it should be a
seventh, rather than a third, fourth, fifth, or sixth part of our
time; for this could not have been known by the light of nature,
any more than the other branches of instituted worship
that are to be performed therein. So that, whether it be the
seventh day in the week, or the first, which we are to observe,
this being founded in the divine will, we conclude it to be a
positive law. This we are obliged to assert, that we may
fence against two extremes, namely, that of those who, on the
one hand, deny the Sabbath to have any thing of a moral circumstance
contained in it; and that of others, who suppose
that there is no idea of a positive law in it. That, in some
respects, the fourth Commandment is a branch of the moral
law, may be proved from the following arguments:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is inserted, among other commandments that are
moral, which were proclaimed by the voice of God from
mount Sinai, whereas the ceremonial and judicial laws were
not; though they were given by divine inspiration. <i>These
words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount, out
of the midst of the fire of the cloud, and the thick darkness,
with a great voice; and he added no more</i>, Deut. v. 22. <i>viz.</i> at
that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, they were written on two tables, with the finger
of God, which none of the other laws were; and were laid up
in the ark before the Lord, Exod. xxxi. 18. all which denotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>the dignity and perpetuity of these laws, above all others that
were ceremonial, judicial, or merely positive.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The Sabbath was enjoined to be observed not only by
the Israelites, who were in covenant with God, together with
their servants, who were made proselytes to their religion, and
were obliged to observe the ceremonial and other positive
laws; but it was also to be observed by the stranger within
their gates, namely, the Heathen, who dwelt among them, who
were not in covenant with God, and did not observe the ceremonial
law; these were obliged to obey the Sabbath, it being,
in many respects, a branch of the moral law.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) If the observation of the Sabbath had been a duty of
the ceremonial, and, in no respects, of the moral law, it would
have been wholly abolished at the death of Christ; but, though
then the day was altered, yet there was still a Sabbath observed,
after his resurrection, even when the ceremonial law was
no longer in force.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The weekly Sabbath is distinguished from all the ceremonial
festivals; which are also called <i>sabbaths</i>, in that God
lays a special claim to it, as his own day; and therefore it is
called, in this Commandment, <i>The sabbath of the Lord thy
God</i>; and it is styled, <i>his holy day</i>; Isa. lviii. 13. by way of
eminence, to distinguish it from other days, which he has appointed
to be, in other respects, devoted to his service; and
when changed, it is called The <i>Lord’s day</i>, Rev. i. 10. which
is a peculiar honour put upon it. For these reasons we conclude,
that the Sabbath has in it something moral, and is not a
part of the ceremonial law.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. It is objected, that the Sabbath is included, by the
apostle, among the ceremonial laws, which were designed to
be abrogated, under the gospel-dispensation; and therefore he
says, in Col. ii. 16, 17. <i>Let no man therefore judge you in meat
or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon;
or of the Sabbath days; which are a shadow of things to come;
but the body is of Christ.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that by the Sabbath days,
which are <i>a shadow of things to come</i>, we are to understand
the Jewish festivals; such as the new moons, the passover,
pentecost, the feast of tabernacles, &amp;c. which are often called
sabbaths: wherein holy convocations were held. So that when
the apostle says, <i>Let no man judge you</i>, in respect of this matter,
he means, let none have occasion to reprove you for your
observing of those days, which were merely ceremonial, the
design whereof was to typify the gospel-rest. Now, that the
apostle does not mean the weekly Sabbath, is plain; for hereby
he would contradict his own practice, and that of the churches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>in his day, who observed it; whereas, the other sabbaths were
abolished, together with the ceremonial law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is evident, that he intends no more than the
ceremonial sabbaths, or Jewish festivals; because he adds,
<i>Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink</i>, as well as
<i>in respect of an holy day</i>, &amp;c. by which he does not mean, let
no man have reason to judge or condemn you for gluttony or
drunkenness, but for your abstaining from several sorts of
meat, forbid by the ceremonial law; by which he means that
the distinction of meats is removed under the gospel-dispensation.
And consequently the ceremonial sabbaths, or holy days,
are taken away; which are intended by the <i>sabbath day</i> in that
place, and not the weekly Sabbath; and therefore our translation
rightly renders it, the <i>sabbath days</i>, not the Sabbath day.
Or if it ought to be rendered <i>the sabbath day</i>, or the weekly
Sabbath, because it is distinguished from the holy days before
mentioned; then it may be farther replied to it, that he means
the seventh-day Sabbath, which was abolished, together with
the ceremonial law, in opposition to the Lord’s day; and how
far this was a sign or shadow of good things to come, will be
considered in what will be replied to the next objection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. It is farther objected, by those who pretend that the
Sabbath is a branch of the ceremonial law, that it is said, in
Exod. xxxi. 16, 17. <i>The children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath
throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It
is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that whenever the weekly
Sabbath has an idea annexed to it, agreeably to that of the
ceremonial law; as when it is said to be <i>a sign</i> between God
and Israel, as in this scripture, we are to understand nothing
hereby, but that there was a ceremonial accommodation annexed
to it, as an ordinance for their faith, in particular, signifying
the gospel-rest; which signification was not annexed to it from
the beginning; but when it was given to Israel. From the beginning,
it was not a type; but when God gave the ceremonial
law, it was made a type. Even as the rainbow, which proceeds
from natural causes, and was, doubtless, set in the heavens
before Noah’s time; yet it was not ordained to be a sign
of the covenant between God and him, till God ordered it to
be so, in his time. Thus God ordained the Sabbath to be a
type or sign to Israel, when he gave them the ceremonial law,
though it was not so before. And at Christ’s resurrection it
ceased to be an ordinance, for their faith in the gospel-rest, or
to be observed, when another day was substituted in the room
of it, to wit, the first day of the week.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 3. It is farther objected, that when the observation of
the Sabbath was enjoined, God bade the Israelites, in Deut. v.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>15. to <i>remember that</i> they were <i>servants in the land of Egypt,
and that the Lord</i> their <i>God brought</i> them <i>out thence through a
mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm</i>; and <i>therefore commanded
them to keep the Sabbath-day</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That God’s bringing his people out of Egypt, is no argument
that this is a part of the ceremonial law, which was given
soon after that time. For we read in the preface to the ten
Commandments, of his bringing his people out of the land of
Egypt; which is assigned as a reason why they should observe
all the Commandments. Therefore it might as well be
inferred, that they are all a part of the ceremonial law, as that
the fourth Commandment is so; because enforced by the same
motive.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Though this particular reason is given to induce the
Israelites to observe this Commandment, and it is in a more
especial manner, applied to that dispensation of providence
which they were lately under; yet this could not be said to
take place in the first institution of the Sabbath, if we suppose
that it was instituted before Moses’s time, which we shall endeavour
to prove under a following head.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. This particular reason, taken from their having been
<i>servants in Egypt</i>, is added to enforce the obligation laid on
masters, to let their servants rest on the Sabbath-day; namely,
because they themselves were once servants in Egypt, without
any regard had herein to the matter of the Commandments,
or any intimation that it is a branch of the ceremonial law.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall now consider when this law, relating to the
observation of the Sabbath, was first given. There are various
opinions about this matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some think the Sabbath was first instituted when God
spake to Israel from mount Sinai; inasmuch as it is one of the
ten Commandments, which God gave them from thence<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c013'><sup>[214]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>But to this it may be replied, that the Sabbath was observed
some days before Israel came into the wilderness of Sinai,
viz. when they were in the wilderness of Sin. Thus Moses,
when speaking concerning their gathering twice as much <i>manna</i>
as was usual, the day before the Sabbath, assigns this is as a
reason for it, <i>To morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto
the Lord</i>, Exod. xvi. 13. And that this was before they encamped
at mount Sinai, appears from hence, namely, that it is
said, that <i>they came into the wilderness of Sin on the fifteenth
day of the second month</i>, ver. 2. Whereas they did not come
into the wilderness of Sinai, till the <i>third month</i>, chap. xix. 1.
Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Others fix the Epocha of the giving this law, from their
coming into the wilderness of Sin; this being the first time, in
which the Sabbath is expressly said to be observed, in scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that nothing can be justly inferred
from the mode of expression, used by Moses in this
scripture, as though it argued the giving a new law, that had
not been before observed; but only the putting them in mind
of the observation of that day, which had, for some time been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>disregarded; and accordingly it is assigned as a reason of their
gathering twice the quantity of manna on the sixth day, which
supposes that they knew before hand, that they were to rest
on the seventh; though it is highly probable, that the observation
of this Commandment had been neglected, for some years
past while they were in Egypt; and it may be, that they were
not suffered, by those who held them there in bondage, to observe
this, and many other of the divine laws. Nevertheless,
the memory of the Sabbath was not wholly lost among them,
which Moses puts them now in mind of.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most probable opinion therefore relating to the institution
of the Sabbath, is, that it was given to man from the beginning;
which may be argued,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) From the reason annexed to the Commandment, to
wit, God’s resting from his work of creation; and it immediately
follows, that when he rested from his work, he blessed
and sanctified the seventh day; that so man might celebrate
and commemorate his power and glory displayed therein, Gen.
ii. 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> To this it is objected; that God’s blessing and sanctifying
the seventh day, may be understood <i>proleptically</i>, as denoting,
that at first he sanctified, or ordained that it should be
a Sabbath, to his people in the following ages; and that this
did not take place till Moses’s time; and accordingly they
suppose, that he having been speaking of the creation of the
world, and God’s resting from his work, gives them to understand,
that this was the reason of the law, which was now given
them, concerning the observation of the Sabbath, which they
never heard of before.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> But to this it may be replied, That this sense of the
text will appear very absurd to any unprejudiced person; since
if God’s resting from his work, which is mentioned immediately
before, as the reason of his sanctifying the seventh day,
is to be taken literally, why must his sanctifying the Sabbath
be taken figuratively? if the one be an account of what was
just done, why should the other be an account of what was not
to take place till two thousand and five hundred years after?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) If God had a church in the world, and public worship
was performed by them from Adam to Moses’s time, then,
there were set times, in which they were to meet together for
that end, and consequently a Sabbath, which was equally necessary
for the good of the church, in foregoing as well as following
ages; and therefore we cannot suppose that it should
be denied that privilege then, which had been granted it ever
since; or, that from Moses’s time they should be obliged to
celebrate the glory of God, as their Creator, sovereign Ruler,
and bountiful Benefactor; and that a seventh part of time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>should be allotted them for this service, by his express command,
and yet he should lose the glory, and his people the advantage
arising from it, before that time.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> It is objected to this, that the scripture is wholly silent
as to this matter, and therefore nothing can be concluded in
favour of the argument we are maintaining.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> Some think that the scripture is not wholly silent as
to this matter; but that it may be inferred from what we read
in Gen. iv. 3, 4. in which it is said, that <i>in process of time it
came to pass, that Cain brought an offering unto the Lord</i>;
which was, doubtless, an instance of public worship. We
render the words <i>in process of time</i>; but they may, with equal
justice, be rendered, as it is observed in the margin, <i>at the end
of days</i>; that is, at the end of that cycle of days which we
generally call <i>a week</i>, or on the seventh day; then the offering
was brought, and the solemn worship performed, and hereby
the Sabbath sanctified according to God’s institution. But if
this argument be not allowed of, it does not follow that the
scripture’s not mentioning their observing a Sabbath, gives us
just ground to suppose that they did not observe any. It
might as well be argued, that because the scripture speaks very
little of any public worship performed before the flood, that
therefore there was none in the world; or, that because we do
not read of the church’s observing a Sabbath, and many other
parts of instituted worship all the time of the judges, which is
said to be <i>about the space of four hundred and fifty years</i>, Acts
xiii. 20. therefore it follows that a Sabbath, was not observed
by them, during the whole of that interval, and all instituted
worship was wholly neglected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing to be inquired into is, whether the Sabbath
was instituted before or after the fall of our first parents?
And it may be observed; that it appears to have been instituted
before their fall; because the reason of its institution was
God’s resting from his work of creation, of which we read
before the account of their fall, as appears from the scripture
before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> It is objected that Adam in innocency had no manservant
nor maid-servants, nor stranger within his gate; and
therefore was not in a capacity of observing this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That before the world
was increased, our first parents might observe the principal
thing contained in this Commandment, by setting apart a day
for religious worship: and when the world increased, the other
part of the Commandment, which was only circumstantial,
might take place. And, indeed, this objection might be as
much alleged against Adam’s being obliged to yield obedience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>to the fifth, seventh, and eighth Commandments, as
against his obeying the fourth.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. It is farther observed, in this answer, that the day
which we call a seventh part of time, was the seventh day of
the week, from the beginning of the world, till the resurrection
of Christ; and the first day of the week, ever since, to
continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian Sabbath,
or the Lord’s day. That the seventh day of the week
was observed as a Sabbath, at first, is taken for granted; and
we do not find that it was abolished by a positive law, so that
there should be no Sabbath; but the day was changed, by substituting
another in the room of it. If, according to the fourth
Commandment, there is to be but one Sabbath in the week,
and the other six days thereof are allowed for our own lawful
employments; and if the first day of the week can be proved,
as we shall attempt to do, to be the Christian Sabbath, then it
follows, that the seventh day ceases to be a Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be, indeed, observed, from several ecclesiastical
writers, that some in the three first centuries, observed, both
the seventh and the first day of the week. As for the apostles,
they often assembled with the Jews, in their synagogues,
on the seventh day, Acts xiii. 14. and xvii. 2. but this was
done with a design to propagate the Christian religion among
them, which could not, with equal conveniency, be done on
other days. And the church afterwards met together on that
day, as well as the Lord’s day, apprehending that though it
was not now to be reckoned God’s holy day, or the Christian
Sabbath; yet it was expedient, that hereby they should keep
up the memory of his having, on that day, finished the work
of creation; and others kept it as a day of fasting, accompanied
with other religious exercises, in memory of Christ’s lying
that day in the grave. But this can hardly be justified in
them. However, it is evident that they did not pay the same
regard to it as the Lord’s day, nor style it God’s holy day, nor
the Christian Sabbath, by way of eminency. And some have
expressly intimated, that whatever regard they paid to the seventh
day, or what assemblies soever they held for worship
therein, they did not observe it in the same way as the Jews
did<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c013'><sup>[215]</sup></a>; neither were they obliged to hold meetings on that day,
as they were on the Lord’s day, it being, in part, left to their
discretion; and it was supposed, that they had sufficient leisure
from their secular callings; and therefore might attend to the
worship of God on that day, as an opportunity offered itself;
though they did not count it equally holy with the Lord’s day;
nor were they obliged, when the worship was over, to abstain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>from their secular employment<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c013'><sup>[216]</sup></a>. But this I only mention
occasionally, to obviate an objection taken from the practice of
some of the ancient church, in observing the seventh day of
the week, which does not much affect the cause we are maintaining,
our design being to prove that the first day of the
week is ordained to be the Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>But before we enter on that subject, it may be necessary, to
prepare our way for it, to premise,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That it does not, in the least, derogate from the honour
and glory of God, to change the Sabbath from the seventh to
the first day of the week. It would, indeed, derogate from
the glory of God, if he should take away one Sabbath, and not
institute another in the room of it; for then he would lose the
honour of that public worship, which he has appointed to be
performed on that day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if there be a greater work than that of creation,
to be remembered and celebrated, it tends much more to the
advancing the glory of God, to appoint a day for the solemn
remembrance thereof, than if it should be wholly neglected.
And to this we may add, that if all men must honour the Son,
even as they honour the Father, then it is expedient, that a
day should be set apart for his honour, namely, the day on
which he rested from the work of redemption, or, as the apostle
says, <i>ceased from it, as God did from his</i>, Heb. iv. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It was expedient, that God should alter the Sabbath,
from the seventh to the first day of the week; for,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Hereby Christ took occasion to give a display of his
glory, and in particular of his sovereign authority, to enjoin
what time he would have us set apart for his worship under
the gospel-dispensation, as well as what worship he will have
performed therein; and to discover himself to be, as he styles
himself; <i>The Lord of the Sabbath day</i>, Matt. xii. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We, in the observation thereof, signify our faith, in a
public manner, that Christ is come in the flesh, and that the
work of our redemption is brought to perfection; and consequently,
that there is a way prepared for our justification and
access to God, as our God, in hope of finding acceptance in
his sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. All the ordinances of gospel-worship have a peculiar relation
to Christ; therefore it is expedient that the time in
which they are to be performed, under this present gospel-dispensation,
should likewise have relation to him; therefore
that day must be set apart in commemoration of his work of
redemption, in which he finished it, and that was the first day
of the week.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>This leads us to consider, what ground we have to conclude
that the Sabbath was changed, from the seventh to the first
day of the week after the resurrection of Christ. And this
will appear,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) From the example of Christ and his apostles, who celebrated
the first day of the week as a Sabbath, after his resurrection.
Thus we read in John xx. 19. that <i>the same day at
evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were
shut, where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,
came Jesus and stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be
unto you</i>. And ver. 26. <i>After eight days</i>, or the eighth day
after, inclusive, <i>again his disciples were within; then came
Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said,
Peace be unto you</i>. Where we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That it was not merely an occasional meeting, but a
fixed one, which returned weekly. Therefore they met eight
days after, or the following first day of the week; which was
the second Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] On both these days of their meeting together for public
worship, Christ appeared in the midst of them, and spake
peace unto them; which includes his owning the day, and
confirming their faith in the observation of it as a Sabbath, for
the future.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> It is objected, that the reasons of the apostles’ meeting
together on the first day of the week, was for fear of the
Jews; and not because it was substituted in the room of the
seventh day, as a Sabbath perpetually to be observed.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that they did not meet
together for fear of the Jews; but when they were assembled,
the doors were shut for fear of them. Besides, it may be
farther replied, that the fear of persecution would have been
no warrant for them, not to keep the seventh-day-Sabbath, or
to substitute another day in the room of it. To all which we
might add, that they might more securely meet together on
the seventh day of the week, than on any other day, if they
were afraid of disturbance from the Jews; for then they were
engaged in worship themselves; and, it is probable, would be
rather inclined to let them alone, for want of leisure, to give
them disturbance in their worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It farther appears, that the Sabbath was changed from
the seventh to the first day of the week, in that this was a
day, in which the church met, together with the apostles, for
solemn public worship. Thus we read in Acts xx. 7. that
<i>upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together
to break bread, Paul preached unto them</i>. Where we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That it was not a private, but a public meeting of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>church; for it is said, that the disciples, that is, the church,
met together.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] It was not a day occasionally appointed by the apostle,
but the stated usual time of their meeting; for it is not said
Paul designed to preach to them on that day, and therefore
they met together; but when they came together, <i>on the first
day of the week</i>, that is, on the day of their usual meeting,
<i>Paul preached unto them</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] The apostle had been with them some days before; for
it is said in the foregoing verse, that <i>he abode there seven days</i>.
Why did they not meet together, and he preach to them the
day before, to wit, the seventh day of the week, on which day
he was with them; but because that was no longer a Sabbath,
but changed to the first day?</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] The end of their meeting was to break bread. Now,
though the word is to be preached in season and out of season;
yet no day is so proper to break bread on, or celebrate the
Lord’s supper, as that on which he rose from the dead. Besides,
when a day is particularly described as that which is set
apart for solemn worship, such as preaching and breaking of
bread is supposed to be, that must be understood to be the
Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] They could not be said now to meet together for fear of
the Jews, as was before objected to their observing the first
Sabbath; for it was at Troas, where the Jews had nothing to
do, nor could they persecute them; for it was a church of converted
Gentiles.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj. 1.</i> It is objected, that the word which we render the
<i>first day of the week</i><a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c013'><sup>[217]</sup></a>, might be rendered <i>one day</i> of the week,
or on a certain day.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> Our translation of the Greek word, is by far the most
proper, as all know, who understand that language. Besides,
the same words are used in John xx. 1. and Luke xxiv. 1. in
both which scriptures Christ’s resurrection is said to be <i>on the
first day of the week</i>; how preposterous would it be, to render
them, on a certain day of the week? and if they are, in those
scriptures, and others that might be referred to, to be rendered,
the first day of the week, as all allow they must, why
should they be rendered otherwise in the text under our present
consideration?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj. 2.</i> It is farther objected, that their meeting together, on
the first day of the week, to break bread, does not argue it to
be a Sabbath; because formerly the Lord’s supper used to be
administered whenever the word was preached, and that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>on other days, besides the first day of the week; yea, we read,
that in some ages of the church, the word was preached, and
the Lord’s supper administered, every day.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, That though the Lord’s
supper may be administered on another day, yet this is said
to be the day more especially appointed for this solemn ordinance,
or for public worship, as has been already observed.
Besides, though the Lord’s supper was administered on other
days after this: yet it will be hard to prove that it was administered
on any other day but the Lord’s day, in the apostles
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The change of the Sabbath, from the seventh to the first
day of the week, may be farther argued from 1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2.
in which the apostle says, As I have given order to the churches
of Galatia, even so do ye. <i>Upon the first day of the week, let
every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered
him; that there be no gatherings when I come.</i> In which
words we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That there is a work of charity recommended; a duty
most proper for the Sabbath, as a testimony of our thankfulness
to God for spiritual blessings, held forth to, or received by
us, on that day; and it is a day in which our hearts are most
like to be enlarged to others, when most affected with the love
of God to us. Those duties which the prophet recommends
as suitable to a fast, which God had chosen, are very suitable
to all public ordinances, and in particular to Sabbaths, namely,
to <i>loose the bands of wickedness</i>, and to <i>undo the heavy burdens,
and to deal forth bread to the hungry</i>, Isa. lviii. 6, 7. If the
poor of the church were to be provided for, this was to be
done, not by a private, but a public collection, whereby
more might be raised, and no burden laid on particular persons.
It is moreover said, that they were to <i>lay by as God
had prospered them</i>; that is, not only in proportion to the increase
of their worldly substance, or the success that attended
their secular employments on other days; but their compassion
to the poor ought to be enlarged, in proportion to the spiritual
advantage they received from Christ, under his ordinances.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] This was not to be done on one single first day of the
week, but on the return of every first day; as all who read
this scripture impartially must understand it<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c013'><sup>[218]</sup></a>. Therefore it
follows, that the first day of the week was a day in which the
church met together for solemn, public, and stated worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] It was not commanded only to this church at Corinth,
but is agreeable to what had been commanded to <i>all the
churches of Galatia</i>; therefore it follows, that the churches of
Galatia were obliged to observe the first day of the week, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>well as that at Corinth. And inasmuch as this epistle is directed
to <i>all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus
Christ</i>, 1 Cor. i. 2. it may by a parity of reason, be applied to
them; and accordingly it may be argued, that it was a universal
practice of the church, at that time, to meet together for
religious worship, on the first day of the week, which argument
cannot but have some weight in it, to prove the doctrine
that we are maintaining, relating to the change of the Sabbath,
from the seventh to the first day of the week.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The change of the Sabbath, from the seventh to the
first day of the week, farther appears, in that there is a day,
mentioned in the New Testament, which is styled <i>the Lord’s
day</i>. Thus it is said, <i>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day</i>,
Rev. i. 10. Where it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That there is a peculiar claim that Christ lays to this
day as his own, distinct from all other days. As the seventh
day of the week was, before this, called, as it is in this Commandment,
<i>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God</i>, and elsewhere,
his <i>holy day</i>, Isa. lviii. 13. so there is a peculiar day which
our Saviour, who is the Lord here spoken of, claims as his
holy day. And what can this be, but that day which he has
instituted in commemoration of his having finished the work
of our redemption?</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] It may be farther observed, that when God is said to
lay claim to things in scripture, it denotes, that they are of his
appointment, and for his glory. Thus the bread and the wine
in that ordinance, which Christ has appointed in remembrance
of his death, is called <i>the Lord’s supper</i>, or <i>the Lord’s table</i>,
denoting that it is an ordinance of his own appointment; in
like manner <i>the Lord’s day</i> may be fitly so called for this reason,
as instituted by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arguments that have hitherto been brought to prove
that the Sabbath was changed from the seventh to the first day
of the week, are principally such as are founded on a scripture-consequence.
We shall now proceed to prove that this
consequence is just, <i>viz.</i> that because the first day of the week
was observed by our Saviour, his apostles, and the church in
general, as the Lord’s day, that is, a day instituted by him, in
commemoration of his having finished the work of our redemption;
therefore we ought to observe it for that end. Here it
may be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is not to be supposed, that it was universally
observed by the church at random, or by accident, without
some direction given them herein. For since the apostles
were appointed to erect the gospel-church, and, as God’s ministers,
to give laws to it, relating to the instituted worship
that was to be performed therein, it is as reasonable to suppose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>that they gave direction concerning the time, in which
public solemn worship should be performed.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Whatever the apostles ordered the church to observe,
in matters belonging to religious worship, they did it by divine
direction; otherwise the rules they laid down for instituted
worship, could not be much depended on; and they, would
doubtless, have been blamed, as not having fulfilled the commission,
which they received from Christ, to <i>teach</i> the church
<i>to observe all things whatever he had commanded them</i>. Nor
could the apostle have made this appeal to the church as he
does; <i>I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
God</i>, Acts xx. 27. and elsewhere, <i>I have received of the Lord
that which also I delivered unto you</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 23. and <i>I delivered
unto you first of all that which I also received</i>, chap. xv.
3. Nor would he have acted agreeably to the character he
gave of himself and the rest of the apostles; concerning whom
he says, <i>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required
in stewards, that a man be found faithful</i>, chap. iv. 1. And
he says concerning himself, <i>I have obtained mercy of the Lord
to be faithful</i>, chap. vii. 25. And elsewhere, <i>If any man think
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the
things that I write unto you, are the commandments of the Lord</i>,
chap. xiv. 37. and consequently, that whatever directions he
gave about the time, as well as mode of worship, were instamped
with his authority; therefore, an apostolic intimation
contained a divine command relating hereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those things that were delivered to the church, by persons
under divine inspiration, are not to be reckoned among the
traditions which the Papists plead for, which took their rise in
those ages when inspiration was ceased. The apostle uses
the word <i>tradition</i> in the same sense in which we are to understand
a divine oracle, or a command given by those who
were divinely inspired; and accordingly he says, <i>I praise you,
brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances</i>,
or, as it is in the margin, <i>traditions, as I have delivered
them to you</i>, chap. xi. 2. and elsewhere, he exhorts them,
to <i>hold the traditions which they had been taught, whether by
word, or his epistle</i>, 2 Thess. ii. 15. that is, all those things
which had been communicated to them by divine inspiration,
in whatever form they were transmitted to them, whether by
word or writing; which different circumstances of imparting
them, do not in the least detract from their divine authority.
The laws which God gave to his church, were either immediately
from himself, as the ten Commandments, or else they
were given by those who were inspired for that purpose; and,
indeed, the greatest part of gospel-worship was of this latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>sort; and what was transmitted by the apostles relating hereunto,
was either verbal or real; the former containing an intimation
of what they had received of the Lord, the latter was
enforced by their example and practice; which, supposing them
to be under divine inspiration, was a sufficient warrant for the
faith and practice of the church, whether relating to the mode
or time of worship; and consequently the practice and example
of the apostles and church, in their day, in observing the
first day of the week, is a sufficient argument to convince us
concerning the change of the Sabbath, from the seventh to the
Lord’s day, which was to be observed, by the church, in all
succeeding ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to that question which is proposed by some, namely,
when it was that Christ gave instructions to the apostles, concerning
the change of the Sabbath? It is an over-curious enquiry,
since it is enough for us to conclude, that this, together
with other laws given by them, relating to the gospel-dispensation,
were given by him, during that interval of time, in
which <i>he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible
proofs, being seen of them forty days, speaking of the
things pertaining to the kingdom of God</i>, Acts i. 3. of which,
we may reasonably suppose this to have been one. But if
this be not reckoned sufficient for the confirming our faith
therein, we have the highest reason to conclude, that it was
given by the inspiration of the Spirit, whom Christ had before
promised unto the apostles to guide <i>them into all truth</i>; and
that he should <i>shew them things to come</i>, John xvi. 13. by
which we are to understand, that he was to lead them, not only
into those truths, which were necessary for them to know as
Christians, but to impart to the churches as ministers, as a
rule of faith and practice. This is what, I think, may give us
sufficient satisfaction, as to the divine original of the Lord’s
day, without our being obliged to have recourse to an ecclesiastical
establishment, without a divine institution; which would
very much detract from the dignity and glory of it, and the
regard that we ought to pay to it, as the Lord’s holy day.
We have considered it as instituted by the apostles; and that
they had instructions in all things relating to the edification of
the church; and that they were so faithful in what they imparted,
that they cannot be, in the least, suspected of intruding
any invention of their own into the worship of God, in this,
any more than any other branch thereof, to suppose which,
would leave us in the greatest uncertainty, as to what concerns
matters of the highest importance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus concerning the observation of the Lord’s day, as
founded on a divine warrant, given to the church by the ministry
of the apostles, who were appointed, by God, to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>known those laws to them, which respect the manner and time
in which he will be worshipped, under the gospel-dispensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing to be considered, is, that the church in, and
after the apostles time, universally attended to the religious
observation of the Lord’s day; which was celebrated as a
Sabbath in all succeeding ages. This is so evident, from the
history of what relates thereunto, that it needs no proof. That
the apostles and the church, in their day, observed it, has been
already considered; and that the observation thereof was continued
in the church, after their death, appears from the writings
of most of the Fathers, who speak of it as a day in which
the church met together for public worship, and paid a much
greater deference to it than any of the other days of the week,
wherein they occasionally attended on the exercise of religious
duties. Thus Ignatius, who lived in the beginning of the second
Century, advises every one who loved Christ, to celebrate
the Lord’s day, which was consecrated to his resurrection;
and he calls it the queen, and chief of all days<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c013'><sup>[219]</sup></a>. Also Justin
Martyr, who lived about the middle of the same Century, in
one of his apologies for the Christians, says, That on that day,
which they, viz. the Heathen, call Sunday, all who live in
cities or villages, meet together in the same place, where the
writings of the apostles and prophets are read, and we all assemble;
it being the day in which God finished the creation,
and Jesus Christ, our Saviour, rose from the dead. For the
day before Saturday he was crucified, and the day after it, that
is, Sunday, he appeared to his apostles and disciples, and instructed
them in those things which we propose to your consideration<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c013'><sup>[220]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the third Century, when persecution so much raged against
the church, it is well known, that Christians distinguished themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>by the character of observers of the Lord’s day, which
they reckoned a badge of Christianity<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c013'><sup>[221]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>I need not descend any lower, to prove that the Lord’s day
was universally observed by the church, in commemoration of
Christ’s resurrection, in all succeeding ages; for that is generally
allowed. Therefore, all that I shall add to illustrate
this argument, taken from the practice of the Christian church,
from our Saviour’s resurrection, to this day, is,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it cannot reasonably be supposed, that God would
suffer his church universally to run into so great a mistake, as
to keep a wrong day as a weekly Sabbath; and that not only
in one or two, but in all ages, since our Saviour’s time. Now,
whatever error particular churches have been suffered to imbibe,
God has not left them all in general; and that before the
corruption and apostasy of the church of Rome, as well as
since the Reformation, to be deceived, which they must be
said to have been, had they esteemed that God’s holy day,
which he has neither instituted, nor owned as such.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d</i>, God has not only suffered all his churches to go on in
this error, if it be an error, and not undeceived them, but he
has, at the same time, granted them many signal marks of his
favour; and has, to this day, in many instances, owned the
strict and religious observation thereof; which we can hardly
suppose he would have done, if it were not of his own institution;
nor that he would have given a sanction to it, by being
present with his people, when attending on him therein, in the
ordinances of his own appointment. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. The proportion of time that is to be observed as a weekly
Sabbath. Thus it is said in this answer, we are to keep
holy to God, one whole day in seven. A day is either artificial
or natural. The former is the space of time from the sun’s
rising, to its setting; the latter contains in it the space of twenty
four hours. Now the Lord’s day must be supposed to continue
longer than the measure of an artificial day; otherwise
it would fall short of a seventh part of time. But this has not
so many difficulties attending it, as that has which relates to
the time of the day when it begins. Nevertheless, we have
some direction, as to this matter, from the intimation given us,
that Christ rose from the dead <i>on the first day of the week,
very early in the morning, while it was yet dark</i>, John xx. 1.
Luke xxiv. 1. Therefore the Lord’s day begins in the morning,
before sun rising; or, according to our usual way of reckoning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>we may conclude, that it begins immediately after midnight,
and continues till mid-night following; which is our
common method of computing time, beginning the day with
the morning, and ending it with the evening; and it is agreeable
to the Psalmist’s observation; <i>Man goeth forth to his work,
and to his labour</i> in the morning, <i>until the evening</i>, Psal. civ.
23. Rest, in order of nature, follows after labour; therefore
the night follows the day; and consequently the Lord’s day
evening follows the day, on which account it must be supposed
to begin in the morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, if the Sabbath begins in the evening, religious worship
ought to be performed sometime, at least, in the evening;
and then, soon after it is begun, it will be interrupted by the
succeeding night, and then it must be revived again the following
day. And, as to the end of the Sabbath, it seems not so
agreeable, that, when we have been engaged in the worship of
God in the day, we should spend the evening in secular employments;
which cannot be judged unlawful, if the Sabbath
be then at an end. Therefore, it is much more expedient, that
the whole work of the day should be continued as long as our
worldly employments are on other days; and our beginning
and ending the performance of religious duties, should in some
measure, be agreeable thereunto. Again, this may be proved
from what is said in Exod. xvi. 23. <i>To-morrow is the rest of
the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.</i> Whereas, if the Sabbath had
begun in the evening, it would rather have been said, this evening
begins the rest of the holy Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another scripture generally brought to prove this argument,
is in John xx. 19. <i>The same day at evening, being the first day
of the week, when the doors were shut, where the disciples were
assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the
midst, and said unto them, Peace be unto you</i>; it is called <i>the
evening of the same day</i>; so that the worship which was performed
that day, was continued in the evening thereof. This
is not called the evening of the next day, but of the same day
in which Christ rose from the dead; which was the first Christian
Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> To this it is objected, that the ceremonial Sabbaths
under the law, began at evening. Thus it is said, in Lev.
xxiii. 5. <i>In the fourteenth day of the first month, at even, is the
Lord’s passover</i>; and ver. 32. speaking concerning the feast of
expiation, which was on the tenth day of the seventh month,
it is said, <i>It shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest; and ye shall
afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month, at even: From
even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be answered; that the beginning of
sacred days is to be at the same time with that of civil; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>this was governed by the custom of nations. The Jews’ civil
day began at evening; and therefore it was ordained that from
evening to evening, should be the measure of their sacred days.
Our days have another beginning and ending; which difference
is only circumstantial. Whereas, the principal thing enjoined,
is, that one whole day in seven, be observed as a Sabbath
to the Lord.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXVII., CXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXVII.</span> <i>How is the Sabbath, or Lord’s day to be sanctified?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The Sabbath, or Lord’s day, is to be sanctified, by an
holy resting all the day, not only from such works as are, at
all times, sinful, but even from such worldly employments
and recreations as are on other days lawful, and making it
our delight to spend the whole time (except so much of it
as is to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy) in the
public and private exercises of God’s worship; and to that
end we are to prepare our hearts, and with such fore-sight,
diligence and moderation to dispose, and seasonably to dispatch
our worldly business, that we may be the more free
and fit for the duties of that day.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXVIII.</span> <i>Why is the charge of keeping the Sabbath
more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The charge of keeping the Sabbath is more especially
directed to governors of families and other superiors, because
they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to
see that it be observed by all those that are under their
charge; and because they are prone oft-times to hinder them
by employments of their own.</p>

<p class='c012'>In explaining the former of these answers, which more especially
respects the manner how the Sabbath is to be sanctified,
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight,
diligence, and moderation, to dispose, and seasonably to
dispatch, our worldly business, that we may be more free and
fit for the business of that day. We do not read, indeed, that
there is any time sanctified, or set apart by God, in order to
our preparing for the Sabbath; but this matter is left to our
Christian prudence. Yet we read in the New Testament, of
the day of preparation for the Sabbath; that is, the day before
the Jewish Sabbath; which persons who had any sense of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>importance of the work to be performed on the following day,
thought it their duty to prepare for before-hand, at least, to
give dispatch to their worldly business; that their thoughts
might be fixed on the work on which they were to engage on
the day ensuing. Thus we read, that <i>that day was the preparation,
and the Sabbath drew on: And they returned and prepared
spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day, according
to the commandment</i>, Luke xxiii. 54, 56. The mixing of ointments
and spices, which were compounded according to the
custom of those times, for the embalming of the dead, was a
work of labour, and not fit to be done on the Sabbath. Therefore
they did this the day before, that they might not be brought
under any necessity of performing that servile work therein,
which might be done on another day. And this practice of
dispatching worldly business, in order to their being prepared
for the sacred employment of the Sabbath, seems to have been
inculcated, when the observation of that day was revived by
Moses in the wilderness of Sin; on which occasion he says,
<i>To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord. Bake
that which ye will bake, and seethe that ye will seethe: and that
which remaineth over, lay it up for you to be kept until the
morning</i>, Exod. xvi. 23. The meaning of which is, they were
to gather the manna, which would take up a considerable time,
and grind or prepare it for baking or seething; which was a
servile, or laborious work, that might as well be done the day
before. Accordingly they were commanded then to dispatch
or finish it, that they might rest in, and sanctity the Sabbath
immediately following.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the time which the more religious Jews took, in preparing
for the Sabbath before it came, something of this may
be learned from the practice of holy Nehemiah; whereby it
appears, that they laid aside their worldly business, in order to
their preparing for the Sabbath the day before, at sun-set, or
when it begun to be dark. Thus it is said, <i>That when the
gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, he commanded
that the gates should be shut, and charged that they
should not be opened till after the Sabbath</i>, Neh. xiii. 19. However,
this is discretionary, and therefore some Jewish writers
observe, that many of them began to prepare for the Sabbath
the evening before, at six o’clock, and some of them at three;
and others spent the whole day before in the dispatch of their
secular business, that they might be better prepared for the
Sabbath; and this, as to what is equitable or moral therein, is,
doubtless, an example to us: so that we may say as Hezekiah
did in his prayer; <i>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth
his heart to seek God; the Lord God of his fathers,
though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the
sanctuary</i>, 2 Chron. xxx. 18, 19.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>This leads us to consider the duties to be performed preparatory
to the right observing the Lord’s day; and, in order
hereunto, we ought, the evening before, to lay aside our care
and worldly business, that our thoughts may not be incumbred,
diverted, or taken up with unseasonable or unlawful concerns
about it. This is a duty very much neglected; and the
omission thereof is one reason of our unprofitable attendance
on the ordinances of God on the Lord’s day. Thus many
keep their shops open till midnight; and by this means make
encroachments on part of the morning of the Lord’s day, by
indulging too much sleep; which occasions drowsiness under
the ordinances, as well as their thoughts being filled with
worldly concerns and business therein. And to this we may
add, that all envyings, contentions, evil surmising against our
neighbour, are to be laid aside, since these will tend to defile
our souls and to deprave our minds, when they ought wholly
to be taken up about divine things. Thus the apostle advises
those to whom he writes, to <i>lay aside all malice, and all guile,
and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speaking</i>, and <i>as new
born babes</i> to <i>desire the sincere milk of the word, that</i> they
might <i>grow thereby</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 1, 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to endeavour to bring our souls into a
prepared frame for the duties of the Lord’s day, the evening
before, by having our thoughts engaged in those meditations
that are suitable thereunto; particularly, we are to consider the
many lost Sabbaths we have to account for, or repent of, as
also the wonderful patience of God, who has, notwithstanding
spared us to the approach of another Sabbath; and what precautions
are necessary to be used, that we may not profane or
trifle it away. It would also be expedient for us to meditate
on the vanity of worldly things, which we have laid aside all
our care about, and think how contemptible the gain thereof
is, if compared with communion with God, which is our great
concern; and therefore we are to consider ourselves as having
a greater work to transact with God on his own day, and desire
to have no disturbance from the world therein. And to
these meditations we ought to join our fervent prayers to God;
that the sins committed by us in former Sabbaths may be forgiven,
that he may not be provoked to withdraw the influences
of his Spirit on the approaching day; and that the world with
the cares thereof, may not then be a snare to us, through the
temptations of Satan, together with the corruption of our own
hearts, whereby our converse with God would be interrupted,
that by this means we may wait on the Lord without distraction.
We ought also to pray, that he would also assist his
ministers in preparing a seasonable word, that may be blest to
ourselves and others. Thus the apostle exhorts the church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>to <i>pray always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
and to watch thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication
for all saints; and for him, that utterance might be given unto
him, that he might open his mouth boldly to make known the
mystery of the gospel</i>, Eph. vi. 18, 19. We ought to be very
importunate with God, that he would sanctify, and fill our
thoughts from the beginning to the end of the Lord’s day,
which he has consecrated for his immediate service and glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider what we are to rest and abstain
from, on the Lord’s day; and this is included in two general
heads, namely, not only from things sinful, but what is in itself
lawful, on other days.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As for those things which are sinful on other days, they
are much more so on the Sabbath; for hereby we contract
double guilt, not only in committing the sin, but in breaking
the Sabbath; and such sins are, for the most part, presumptuously
committed, and greatly tend to harden the heart; and
not only hinder the efficacy of the ordinances, but if allowed
of, and persisted in, are a sad step to apostacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We break the Sabbath by engaging in things that would
be lawful on other days; and that in two particular instances
here mentioned;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) When we engage in worldly employments. These, we
are wholly to lay aside, or abstain from; particularly buying
or selling, or encouraging those who do so. We have a noble
instance of zeal in Nehemiah, relating to this matter;
wherein he says, <i>In those days saw I in Judah, some treading
wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and leading
asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of
burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath
day. And I testified against them in the day wherein they sold
victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought
fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the Sabbath unto the
children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with
the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, what evil thing is this
that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day?</i> Neh. xiii. 15, 16, 17.
And the prophet Jeremiah speaks to the same purpose, when
he prohibits their <i>carrying burdens on the Sabbath day</i>, or <i>doing
any work</i> therein; and exhorts them to <i>hallow the Sabbath
day, as God commanded their fathers</i>, Jer. xvii. 21, 22. This
may tend to reprove those tradesmen who post their books,
state their accounts, or prepare their goods, which are to be
exposed to sale on the following day. And if we do not run
these lengths, in profaning the Sabbath; yet we are highly
guilty when our thoughts and discourse run after our covetousness,
which is, in effect, a saying as they did who complained,
<i>When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat</i>, Amos viii. 5. This
the prophet reproves, when he says, <i>They come unto thee as
the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and
they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their
mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their
covetousness</i>, Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The Sabbath is violated by recreations; which we are
therefore to abstain from: otherwise we spurn at the Sabbath;
accordingly the prophet Isaiah speaks of those who sanctify
<i>the Sabbath</i>, as turning away their <i>foot from doing their pleasure
on God’s holy day, and calling the Sabbath a delight, the
holy of the Lord, honourable, honouring him, not doing their
own ways, nor finding their own pleasure, nor speaking their
own words</i>, Isa. lviii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] The recreations we are to abstain from, on the Lord’s
day, are unnecessary visits by which the worship of God in
families, is interrupted, the minds of men perverted, and filled
with vanity, the motions of the Spirit quenched, and the advantage
of public worship greatly hindered, if not wholly lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Walking in the fields; whereby instead of meditating on
the word, the mind is diverted from it. To which we may
add,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] The taking unnecessary journeys; which, according as
they are circumstanced, will appear to be no other than finding
our own pleasure, and doing our own works on God’s
holy day.</p>

<p class='c006'>We read, indeed, in Acts i. 12. of <i>a Sabbath-day’s journey</i>;
which seems to argue, that it was not unlawful to travel on
the Lord’s day. But, that we may not mistake this matter,
let it be considered, that <i>a Sabbath-day’s journey</i>, according to
Jewish writers, contained the length of two thousand cubits,
or, about a mile; which was, ordinarily speaking, the length
of their cities, together with their respective suburbs. Therefore,
since this is the measure of a Sabbath-day’s journey, it
implies, that they were not to go out of their cities to divert
themselves, or to undertake journeys, under a pretence of business.
Thus they were commanded <i>to abide every man in his
place on the seventh day</i>, Exod. xvi. 29. that is, not to wander
out of their tents, to take the air, though they were obliged to
go out of their tents to the tabernacle, the place of public
worship, which was pitched in the midst thereof, for the conveniency
of coming to it. Hither, indeed, they went, from
their respective tents; which was the only journey they took,
unless in case of necessity, on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this we may add, that it is not lawful, on the Sabbath-day,
for persons to divert themselves by talking of news, or
common affairs; which unseasonable discourse oftentimes gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>a check to those lively frames of spirit we have had under the
word preached; and by indulging such discourse, we not only
break the Sabbath ourselves, but by our example, induce
others to do the same. I do not say but that it may be seasonable
to meditate on the providence of God towards the
church and the world, on the Lord’s day, as well as at other
times; but then we must take heed that his glory, and not
barely our own diversion, is a great inducement thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. When it is said, in the fourth Commandment, that <i>thou
shalt do no manner of work on the Sabbath day</i>, there is an
exception hereunto, or an intimation, that works of necessity
and mercy, though they contain in them something servile or
laborious, may, notwithstanding, be done on the Lord’s day.
Some things are necessary, as they tend to the support of nature;
as eating and drinking; and therefore the providing food
for that end, is, doubtless, lawful; especially if too much time
be not spent therein, too many servants, or others, detained
from the worship of God thereby, or entertainments and splendid
feasts made; in which, variety of things are prepared, to
please the appetite; and all this attended with vain and trifling
conversation, unbecoming the holiness of the day. There are
also other works of necessity, which may be done on the
Sabbath-day, <i>viz.</i> such as are subservient to the worship of
God; without which, it is impossible that the public exercises
thereof should be performed. Thus, under the ceremonial
law, there were many laborious services that attended public
worship; particularly the killing those beasts that were appointed
for sacrifice, on the Sabbath-day; though we are exempted
from this under the gospel-dispensation. To this, it is probable,
our Saviour refers, when he says, ‘Have ye not read in
the law, how that the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath,
and are blameless,’ Matt. xii. 5. that is, perform those
servile works, subservient to public worship; which, according
to your method of reasoning, would be a profaning the Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it is enquired, by some, whether it be lawful to kindle
a fire on the Sabbath-day, since this seems to be forbidden the
Israelites; to whom Moses says, ‘Ye shall kindle no fire
throughout your habitations, upon the Sabbath-day,’ Exod.
xxv. 3. Some are of opinion, that if this be lawful at present,
agreeably to what we generally practice, it is a peculiar privilege
attending the gospel-dispensation; which may give us occasion
to explain what is meant by this prohibition.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It cannot be hereby forbidden, to kindle a fire, for their
refreshment, in cold weather; for that is as necessary as any
of the other conveniences of life, such as eating, drinking, sitting
down when we are weary, <i>&amp;c.</i> and it was done with very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>little pains or difficulty; so that it would not much hinder the
religious exercises of that day. On the other hand, the not
making a fire, provided the season of the year was extremely
cold, would indispose men for the worship of God. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is most probable, that the meaning of that scripture is
this; that since, at that time, wherein this law was given,
many of them were employed in the work of building and
adorning the tabernacle; which, as all artificers know, required
the kindling of fires for the melting of metals, heating of
iron tools, <i>&amp;c.</i> and, whereas the people might be apt to think,
that, because the building of the tabernacle required expedition,
they might kindle fires, and therewith employ themselves
in the work thereof, on the Sabbath-day. Therefore Moses
tells them, that it was not a work so absolutely necessary, as
that it required, that they should attend to it herein; which
seems to be the reason of that law, which prohibited the kindling
a fire on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the application of this law, to the dressing of food,
which seems to be prohibited in that scripture, ‘Bake that ye
will bake to day, and seethe that which ye will seethe; and
that which remaineth over, lay it up to be kept for you until
the morning,’ Exod. xvi. 23. The meaning thereof seems
to be this; Bake, or seethe that which is necessary for your
food, the day before the Sabbath, and lay up the rest, to be
baked or seethed on the Sabbath. The command more especially
prohibits their gathering manna on the Sabbath, and preparing
it for baking or seething; which would have taken up
too great a part of the day, and have been a diversion from
the religious worship thereof. But the baking or seething,
which would have afforded but a small interruption to the
work thereof, does not seem to have been forbidden.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us to enquire, what judgment we may pass
on the <i>stoning the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day</i>;
which we read of in Numb. xv. 32, <i>&amp;c.</i> The gathering of
sticks for the making a fire on the Sabbath-day, seems to be a
work of necessity; and therefore some may be ready to conclude
that the punishment inflicted on him was too severe.
But, instead of excepting against the greatness of the punishment
inflicted, I would rather infer from hence, that the crime
was very great. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) He might have gathered sticks on other days, and
thereby have provided a sufficient quantity for his necessary
use, on the Sabbath-day; or else, he should have been content
to have been without a fire on that day; rather than give so
ill a precedent of the breach of the Sabbath.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is probable he did this, not to supply his present necessities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>but to increase his store; and, that he did not gather
a few sticks, but a large quantity; which cannot be pretended
to be a work of necessity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It is not unlikely, that the man made a practice of it,
for several Sabbaths together; and so lived in a total contempt
and neglect of God’s public ordinances.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) It is also reasonable to suppose, that he did this presumptuously,
publicly, and in defiance of the divine command,
after having been reproved for it; and he might obstinately
vindicate this wicked practice, and resolve, for the future, to
persist in it; for that is the nature of a presumptuous sin. And
it is plain, that he sinned presumptuously therein; inasmuch
as God, in the verses immediately foregoing, had threatened,
that <i>the soul that doth ought presumptuously</i>, or, as it is in
the margin, <i>with an high hand</i>, who <i>reproached the Lord</i>
herein, <i>should be cut off</i>; and then this account of the man’s
being stoned for gathering sticks on the Sabbath-day, is brought
in as an instance of a just punishment of a presumptuous sinner.</p>

<p class='c006'>These things being duly considered, we cannot take occasion
from hence, to conclude, as many do, that there is this
difference between the legal and the gospel-dispensation, in
that the Sabbath was formerly to be observed more strictly than
now; and that this was a part of the yoke which neither they
nor their fathers were able to bear, the relaxation whereof is
reckoned a branch of that liberty which we have under the
gospel. But this sounds very ill in the ears of all serious
Christians, who think the duties of religion, and the strictness
of our obligation thereunto, a privilege rather than a burden.
Thus concerning the lawfulness of our performing works of
necessity on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>We proceed farther to consider, that works of mercy ought
to be done on that day; such as visiting and preparing medicines
for the sick, relieving the poor, providing food and water
for cattle, and other brute creatures. This our Saviour vindicates
by his practice, and illustrates by asserting the necessity
of <i>lifting out a sheep</i>, that was <i>fallen into a pit</i>, on the
Sabbath-day, Matt. xii. 10-13. However, when we maintain
the lawfulness of performing works of necessity and
mercy, on the Sabbath-day, the following cautions ought to
be attended to;</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] Let the necessity be real, not pretended; of which, God
and our own consciences are the judges.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If we think that we have a necessary call to omit, or
lay aside our attendance on the ordinances of God, on the
Sabbath-day, let us take heed that this necessity be not brought
on us by some sin committed, which gives occasion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>judicial hand of God; and that province, which renders it necessary
for us to absent from them, should be rather submitted
to, than matter of choice or delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] If necessity obliges us to engage in secular employments
on the Lord’s day, as in the instances of those whose
business it is to provide physic for the sick, let us, nevertheless,
labour after a spiritual frame, becoming the holiness of
that day, so far as may consist with what we are immediately
called to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] As we ought to see that the work we are engaged in is
necessary; so we must not spend more time therein than what
is needful.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] If we have a necessary call to engage in worldly matters,
whereby we are detained from public ordinances, we
must endeavour to satisfy others, that the providence of God
obliges us hereunto; that so we may not give offence to them,
or they take occasion, without just reason to follow their own
employments; which would be a sin in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We are to sanctify the Sabbath, by spending the whole
day in the public and private exercises of God’s worship, and
herein to maintain a becoming holy frame of spirit, from the
beginning of the day to the end thereof. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In the beginning thereof; let not too much sleep make
intrenchments on more of the morning of the day than what is
needful, particularly, more than what we allow ourselves before
we begin our employments on other days. And let us
begin the day with spiritual meditations, and carefully watch
against worldly thoughts, as what will give us great interruption
and hinderance in the work thereof. And let us be earnest
with God in prayer, that he would prepare our hearts for the
solemn duties we are to engage in; let us consider the Sabbath
as a very great talent that we are entrusted with; and
that it is of the greatest importance for us to improve it, to
the glory of God and our spiritual advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. While we are engaged in holy duties, especially in the
public ordinances of God’s worship, let us endeavour to maintain
a becoming reverence, and filial fear of God, in whose
presence we are, and a love to his holy institutions, which are
instamped with his authority. Let us moreover watch and
strive against the first motions and suggestions of Satan, and
our corrupt hearts, endeavouring to divert us from, or disturb
us in holy duties. And let us often lift up our hearts to God,
by spiritual, short ejaculatory prayers, for help from him, to
enable us to improve the word, and, at the same time, endeavour
to our utmost, to affect our hearts with a sense of the
great worth of gospel-opportunities. Let us also cherish, improve,
and bless God for all the influences of his Holy Spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>which he is pleased, at any time, to grant to us; or bewail and
lament the want thereof, when they are withheld.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In the intervals between our attendance on the ordinances
of God’s public worship, we are to engage in private duties,
and worship God in, and with our families; and in order
hereunto, call to mind what we have heard, impress it on our
own souls, recommend it to those whom we converse with,
and are concerned for; and take heed that we do nothing, between
one public ordinance and another, which may unfit us
for the remaining duties of the day; but, on the other hand,
strive against, and give a check to the least motions thereof in
our own souls.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The Sabbath is to be sanctified in the evening thereof,
when the public ordinances are over; at which time we are to
call to mind what we have received from God, with thankfulness,
and how we have behaved ourselves in all the parts of
divine worship, in which we have been engaged. Let us enquire,
whether the Sabbath was welcome to us, and we rejoiced
in it as a blessing, as well as set about the observing of
it as a duty? as the Psalmist says, ‘I was glad when they said
unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord,’ Psal. cxxii.
1. Moreover, let us enquire, whether our ends were right in
all the duties we performed? whether the glory of God, and
the good of our own souls, has been our great concern? Or,
whether we have been only influenced by custom, and rested
in a form of godliness, without regarding the power thereof,
and loved the opinion and praise of men more than of God?
Let us enquire, whether our minds, our affections and outward
gestures have been grave, sedate, and composed, and we ready
to receive whatever God has been pleased to impart in his
word? and whether we have had a due sense of the divine perfections
impressed on our spirits, and of the infinite distance
there is between the great God and us? whether we have seen
our need of the word, as Job says, that he <i>esteemed the words
of God’s mouth more than his necessary food</i>? Job xxiii. 12.
and, whether we have not only attended to, but applied every
truth to our own souls, as desiring to retain, improve, and
make it the rule of our conversation?</p>

<p class='c006'>We are also to consider, what we have received from God
under his ordinances; whether we have had any sensible communion
with him, any experiences of his love, or impressions
of his power on our hearts? whether we have had fellowship
with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ? whether, as
we have gone from one ordinance to another, we have gone
from strength to strength, our faith being more lively, our love
to God increased, and our spiritual joy enlarged by every duty?
Let us enquire, whether, we have learned some doctrine from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>the word, which we understood not, or, at least, have been
more confirmed therein, after some degree of wavering, or
have been affected with some truth which we never saw such
a beauty and glory in before? whether we have been melted under
the word; if it has been, as the prophet speaks, <i>like fire</i>;
or, as <i>the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces</i>, Jer. xxiii.
29. or, as the disciples say one to another, <i>Did not our heart
burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while
he opened to us the scriptures?</i> Luke xxiv. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we may comfortably conclude, that we have received
good under the ordinances, if we have been brought into an
holy and lively frame of spirit; and the more we attend to
them, the more our hearts are drawn forth to desire and delight
in them; and especially when public duties fit us for private,
and from the advantage that we receive from such opportunities,
we are more disposed to walk with God in all the
affairs and businesses of life, so that our whole conversation
in this world, receives a tincture from the benefit which we
gain by that communion which we enjoy with God in his ordinances
on his own day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we are to take a view of our behaviour when engaged
in public worship; and if we have received any spiritual advantage,
the glory thereof is to be given to God. But if, on
the other hand, upon a strict and impartial enquiry into the
frame of our spirits under the ordinances, we have, as it too
often happens, reason to complain of our deadness and stupidity
under them; if we have not experienced that sensible
communion with God, which we have at other times enjoyed,
or have reason to say, that we wax worse, rather than better,
under them; let us dread the consequence hereof, lest this
should issue in a judicial hardness of heart, and habitual unprofitableness,
under the means of grace. We ought, in this case,
to search out, and be humbled before God, for that secret sin,
which is as a root of bitterness which springs up within us,
and troubles us; and be still pressing after that special presence
of God in his ordinances, that will have a tendency to
promote the life and power of religion in our souls.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add; that besides our dealing thus with
ourselves in our private retirements, after having attended on
public worship, we are to endeavour to sanctify the Sabbath in
our families, in the evening thereof. Family-worship is to be
neglected no day; but on the Sabbath, it is to be engaged in
with a particular relation to the duties which we have been
performing in public; accordingly it is mentioned in one of
the answers we are explaining, that the charge of keeping the
Sabbath is directed to the governors of families, and other
superiors; inasmuch as they are bound, not only to keep it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those who are
under their charge, and not to hinder them, as many are prone
to do, by employing them in those works which are foreign to
the duties of the day. Masters of families are not only to
restrain immoralities in those who are under their care, on the
Sabbath-day, but to lay their commands on them, to engage
with them in the worship of God therein, as they expect a
blessing from him on their undertakings. Thus Joshua resolves,
that <i>he and his house would serve the Lord</i>, Josh. xxiv.
15. and God speaks to the honour of Abraham, when he says,
<i>I know him that he will command his children and his household
after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord</i>, Gen. xviii.
19. Superiors have no power to dispense with any of God’s
commandments, to disengage those who are under them, from
yielding obedience thereunto. But, on the other hand, they
are obliged to see that all, under their care, perform their duty
to God, as well as to them, and, particularly, that of sanctifying
the Sabbath. Therefore they are to restrain them from
taking their own diversions, or finding their own pleasure in
sinful recreations on the Lord’s day; and impress on them
those suitable exhortations, that may have a tendency to promote
religion in their families; by which means they may
hope for a peculiar blessing from God, in every relation and
condition of life.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXIX., CXX., CXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXIX.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the fourth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the fourth Commandment, are,
all omissions of the duties required, all careless, negligent,
and unprofitable performing of them, and being weary of
them, all profaning the day by idleness, and doing that
which is in itself sinful, and by all needless works, words,
and thoughts about worldly employments and recreations.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXX.</span> <i>What are the reasons annexed to the fourth
Commandment the more to enforce it?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The reasons annexed to the fourth Commandment, the
more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, God allowing
us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving
but one for himself, in these words, [<i>Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work</i>,] from God’s challenging a special
propriety in that day, [<i>The seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God</i>] from the example of God, who, <i>in six
days made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>and rested the seventh day</i>; and from that blessing which
God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a
day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means of
blessing to us in our sanctifying it; [<i>wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it</i>.]</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXI.</span> <i>Why is the word</i> Remember <i>set in the beginning
of the fourth Commandment</i>?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The word <i>Remember</i> is set in the beginning of the
fourth Commandment, partly because of the great benefit of
remembering it; we being thereby helped, in our preparation,
to keep it; and in keeping it better, to keep all the rest
of the commandments, and to continue a thankful remembrance
of the two great benefits of creation, and redemption,
which contain a short abridgment of religion; and partly
because we are very ready to forget it; for that there is less
light of nature for it, and yet it restraineth our natural liberty
in things at other times lawful; that it cometh but
once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between,
and too often take off our minds from thinking of it,
either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it; and that Satan,
with his instruments much labour to blot out the glory, and
even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.</p>

<p class='c012'>The method in which we shall proceed, in speaking to
these answers, shall be,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To consider the sins forbidden in this Commandment;
and these are,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The omission of the duties required. Sins of omission
are exceeding prejudicial; because, though they have a tendency
to harden the heart, and stupify the conscience; yet
they are, of all others, least regarded. As for the omission
of holy duties, on the Sabbath-day; this is a slighting and
casting away a great prize, put into our hands; and therefore,
in such a case, it will be said, <i>Wherefore is there a price</i> put
into <i>the hands of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart
to it</i>, Prov. xvi. 16. It may be also observed, that this is generally
attended with the neglect of secret duties, and is an
in-let to all manner of sins, and to a total apostasy from God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The next thing forbidden in this Commandment is, the
careless performance of holy duties; that is, when our hearts
are not engaged in them, or we content ourselves with a form
of godliness, denying the power thereof, have no sense of
God’s all-seeing eye, or dread of spiritual judgments, or being
given up to barrenness and unprofitableness, under the means of
grace. Such a frame of spirit as this, is always attended with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>a declining state of religion; especially if we do not lament
and strive against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that we greatly sin, when we profane
the day by idleness; and that either by sleeping away a
great part of the morning of the day, as though it were a day
of sloth, and not of spiritual rest, designed for religious exercises;
or drowsiness under the ordinances, as though we had no
concern in them; whereby we give all about us to understand,
that we do, as it were, withdraw our thoughts from the work,
which we pretend to be engaged in. In some, indeed, this
proceeds very much from the weakness of their natural constitution.
Such may be heavy and weary in duty, though they,
are not weary of it; and this is what they lament, and are far
from giving way to; though they are, sometimes, unavoidably
overtaken with it. In this case, though it cannot be excused
from being a sin; yet it is such, as, it is to be hoped, our Saviour
will cover, with the mantle of his love, or, at least, not
charge upon them for their condemnation; though he may reprove
them for it, to bring them under conviction. Thus he
dealt with his disciples, when he <i>came to them, and found them
asleep</i>, Matt. xxvi. 40, 41. and though he tacitly reproves them,
yet he does not infer from hence, that they were wholly destitute
of faith; but charges their unbecoming carriage therein,
on the weakness of faith, being impowered by the infirmities
of nature, when he says, <i>The spirit indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weak</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other sins forbidden in the fourth Commandment,
that are particularly mentioned in this answer, which have been
occasionally insisted on, in considering how the Sabbath is to
be sanctified; in which we have shewn, that, as we are not to
do that which is in itself sinful, so we are to abstain from our
worldly employments and recreations, and endeavour to fence
against that vanity of thoughts, which will have a tendency to
alienate our affections from God, or hinder the success of ordinances;
and therefore we pass them over at present, and
proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The reasons annexed to this Commandment. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is highly reasonable that we should sanctify the Lord’s
day, since he is pleased to allow us six days out of seven, for
the attending to our worldly affairs, and reserves but one to
himself. This supposes that we are allowed to engage in our
secular callings on other days: and therefore, though it be
brought in occasionally, in this commandment, it is a duty belonging
to the second table rather than the first; particularly, it
seems to be a branch of the eighth Commandment; however,
it is alleged as a reason of our observing this Commandment.
It is a very large allowance that God has made, of six days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>in seven, for our own employments. If, on the other hand,
he had allowed us but one day in seven for them, and laid
claim to six days, to be set apart for religious worship, none
would have had reason to complain, since he, being the absolute
Lord of our time, may demand what proportion of it he
pleases; and they who are truly sensible of the real advantage
that there is in the attendance on all God’s holy institutions,
and consider the Sabbath as a privilege and blessing, would
not only think it reasonable, but a great instance of the kindness
of God to man, had this earth so much resembled heaven,
that there should be a perpetual Sabbath celebrated here, as
there is there, where the saints count it their happiness to be
engaged without interruption, in the immediate service of God.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> It is objected, by some, that they cannot spare a seventh
part of time for religious duties, out of their worldly
business; and that it is very hard for them to get bread for
their families, by all their diligence and industry. Others allege,
that the Sabbath is their market-day, wherein, by selling
things, they get more than they do on other days.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> 1. As to the former part of the objection, taken from
the difficulty of persons subsisting their families, it may be replied;
that God is able to made up the loss of the seventh part
of time, so that their not working therein, shall not be a real
detriment, to those who are in the fewest circumstances in the
world, God has ordered it so, that our observing his holy institutions,
shall not, in the end, prove detrimental to us. Thus
when Israel was commanded to rest, and not to cultivate their
land for an whole year together, every seventh year, providence
so ordered it, that they were not sufferers thereby, inasmuch
as the year before brought forth enough for three years,
Lev. xxv. 20-22. and when they were not to gather manna
on the seventh day of the week, there was a double quantity
rained upon them, which they gathered the day before, Exod.
xvi. 22-24. Therefore, why may we not conclude, that, by
the blessing of God, what is lost by our not attending to our
secular callings on the Lord’s day, may be abundantly made
up, by his blessing succeeding our endeavours on other days.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to that part of the objection, in which it is pretended
that the Lord’s day is their market-day, in which they expect
more advantage than on other days; it may be replied, that if
this is true, it arises from the iniquity of the times; and it
should be a caution to us, not to encourage those who expose
their wares to sale on the Sabbath-day; since if there were no
buyers, there would be no sellers; and this public and notorious
sin would be hereby prevented. We have a noble instance
of this in Nehemiah, whose wisdom, zeal, and holy resolution,
put an effectual stop to this practice, in his dealing with those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>who <i>sold fish on the Sabbath-day</i>, Neh. xiii. 16-21. First,
he <i>shut the gates of the city against them</i>; and when he saw
that they continued without the walls, hoping, by some means
or other, to get into the city, or to entice some to come out to
buy their merchandize; then he <i>testified against them</i>, and
commanded them not to continue without the walls, and by
this means, gave a check to that scandalous practice. Moreover,
this gain of iniquity is not to be pretended as a just excuse
for the breach of a positive commandment; since, what
is gotten in a way of presumptuous rebellion against God, it
is not like to prosper, whatever pretence of poverty may be
alleged, to give countenance thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another reason annexed to enforce our observation of the
Sabbath-day, is taken from God’s challenging a special propriety
in it. Thus it is called the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God; a day which he has consecrated, or separated to himself,
and so lays claim to it. Therefore it is no less than sacrilege,
or a robbing of him, to employ it in any thing but what
he requires to be done therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. God sets his own example before us for our imitation
therein. Thus it is said, <i>In six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and rested the seventh day, and hallowed it</i>. It is
observed, that God was six days in making the world; whereas,
had he pleased, he could have created all things with the
same beauty and perfection in which they are at present, in an
instant; but he performed this work by degrees, that he might
teach us, that whatever our hand finds to do, we should do it
in the proper season allotted for it; and as he ceased from his
work on the seventh day, he requires that we should rest from
ours, in conformity to his own example.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The last reason assigned for our sanctifying the Sabbath,
is taking from God’s blessing and sanctifying it, or setting it
apart for an holy use. To bless a day, is to give it to us as a
particular blessing and privilege. Accordingly we ought to
reckon the Sabbath as a great instance of God’s care and compassion
to men, and a very great privilege, which ought to be
highly esteemed by them. Again, for God to sanctify a day,
is to set it apart from a common, to an holy use; and thus we
ought to reckon the Sabbath as a day signalized above all
others, with the character of God’s holy day; and as such, it
is to be employed by us in holy exercises, answerable to the
end for which it was instituted.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. It is observed in the last answer we are explaining,
that the word <i>Remember</i> is set in the beginning of the fourth
Commandment; from whence we may observe, our great
proneness, through worldly business, and Satan’s temptations,
to forget the Sabbath. We may also learn from hence, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>importance of our observing it; without which, irreligion and
profaneness would never universally abound in the world;
and, on the other hand, in our observing this day as we ought
to do, we may hope for grace from God, whereby we may be
enabled to keep his other commandments. Again, the word
<i>Remember</i>, prefixed to this Commandment, not only imports
that we are to call to mind, that this particular day which God
has sanctified, is a Sabbath, or to know what day it is, in the
order of the days of the week; but we ought to endeavour to
have a frame of spirit becoming the holiness of the day, or, to
remember it, so as to keep it holy. It is certain, that it is an
hard matter, through the corruption of nature, to get our
hearts disengaged from the vain amusements and entanglements
of this present world; by which means we lose the advantage
that would redound to us, by our conversing with God
in holy duties. Therefore we are to desire of him, that he
would impress on our souls a sense of our obligation to duty,
and of the advantage which we may hope to gain from it.
And to induce us hereunto, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the profanation of the Sabbath is generally the first
step to all manner of wickedness, and a making great advances
to a total apostasy from God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The observing of it is reckoned as a sign between God
and his people. It is, with respect to him, a sign of his favour;
and with respect to man, it is a sign of their subjection
to God, as their King and Lawgiver, in all his holy appointments.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We cannot reasonably expect, that God should bless us
in what we undertake, on other days, if we neglect to own him,
on his day, or to devote ourselves to him, and thereby discover
our preferring him, and the affairs of his worship, before all
things in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said in explaining this Commandment,
we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That, this may serve to confute those who think that
the observation of days, in general, or, that the keeping the
first day of the week as a Sabbath, is a setting up the ceremonial
law, without distinguishing a right between a ceremonial
and a moral precept. For, how much soever the observation
of the seventh day, might have a ceremonial signification annexed
to it, as it was given to Israel, from mount Sinai, it is
possible for the typical reference thereof, to cease; and yet
the moral reason of the Commandment remain in force to us,
as it is a day appointed by God, in which he is to be worshipped,
so that we may have ground to expect his presence, and
blessing, while attending on him in his holy institutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Others are to blame, who think that every day is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>kept as a Sabbath, pretending that this is most agreeable to a
state of perfection. But this is contrary to God’s allowing us
six days for our own employment; and, indeed, none, who
make use of this argument, do, in reality, keep any day as a
Sabbath, at least, in such a way as they ought.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Others are guilty of a great error, who think that the
Sabbath is, indeed, to be observed; but there is no need of
that strictness which has been inculcated; or, that it should be
kept holy, from the beginning to the end thereof. Some suppose,
that the only design of God in instituting it was, that
public worship should be maintained in the world; and therefore,
that it is sufficient if they attend on it, without endeavouring
to converse with him in secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) What has been said, is directly contrary to their opinion,
who think that the Lord’s day was a mere human institution;
without considering, as has been hinted, that what the
apostles prescribed, relating thereunto, was by divine direction;
which opinion, if it should prevail, would open a door to great
carelessness and formality in holy duties, and would be an inducement
to us to profane the day in various instances.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXXII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXII.</span> <i>What is the sum of the six Commandments,
which contain our duty to man?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sum of the six Commandments, which contain our
duty to man, is to love our neighbour as ourselves, and to
do to others what we would have them do to us.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the first table of the ten Commandments respects our
duty to God, the other contains our duty to our neighbor;
which is comprized in the general idea of <i>love</i>. This
is therefore styled the sum of the following six Commandments;
and it is included in our Saviour’s words; <i>Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself</i>, Matt. xxii. 39. and elsewhere,
<i>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them</i>, chap. vii. 12. Here it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That we are commanded to love our neighbour as ourselves.
This implies in it,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A caution against a selfish temper; as though we were
born only for, or were obliged to do good to none but ourselves.
This is what the apostle reproves, when he says, <i>Men
shall be lovers of their ownselves</i>, 2 Tim. iii. 2. that is, they
shall study and consult the happiness, ease, and comfort of
none but themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It farther implies in it, our using endeavours to promote
the good of all, whom we converse with; and thereby rendering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>ourselves a blessing to mankind. It does not, indeed,
exclude self-love, which it supposes to be a duty; but obliges
us to love others as well as ourselves, in things that relate to
their spiritual and temporal good. This leads us to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Whether we ought to love others better than ourselves;
or what the apostle intends, when he says, <i>Let each esteem
other better than themselves</i>? Phil. ii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> [1.] It cannot be hereby intended, that they, who
have attained a great measure of the knowledge of the truths
of God, should reckon themselves as ignorant of, or unstable
in, the doctrines of the gospel, as those who never made them
the subject of their study and enquiry; nor, that they, who
have had large experience of the grace of God, should conclude
that they have no more experience thereof than those
who are unregenerate, and have not taken one step heavenward.
But,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] The meaning is, that the greatest saint should not think
himself better than the least, any otherwise than as he has received
more from the discriminating grace of God; as the
apostle says, <i>Who maketh thee to differ from another; and what
hast thou, that thou didst not receive?</i> 1 Cor. iv. 7. And,
indeed, such an one may see more sin in himself than he can
see in any other; and therefore, may have reason to reckon
himself, as the apostle speaks, <i>the chief of sinners</i>, 1 Tim. i. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] The best saints would have been as bad as the vilest of
men, had they been left to themselves; and it may be, some
of them who have had less grace, have had fewer talents, and
opportunities of grace, than they have had; which they have
improved better, in proportion to what they have received,
than they have, the many advantages which God has been
pleased to bestow on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Our next enquiry may be, whether our love to our
neighbour should extend so far, as that we should be willing,
were it needful, to lay down our lives for them; as it is said,
in 1 John iii. 16. <i>We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren</i>;
and in Rom. v. 7. <i>Peradventure, for a good man some
would even dare to die.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> [1.] By <i>laying down</i> our <i>lives</i> in these scriptures, is
principally intended hazarding our lives, or exposing ourselves
to the utmost danger, even of death itself, for others. But,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are not to do this rashly, and at all times; but when
God, who is the sovereign Lord of our lives, calls us to it.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This ought not to be for every one, but for the <i>brethren</i>,
especially for those who are more eminently useful in the
church of God than ourselves or others. Accordingly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>apostle says, <i>for a good man</i>; that is, one who is a common
good, or a blessing to many others, <i>one would even dare to die</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] This must be, at such times, when in exposing ourselves
for the sake of others, we give our testimony to the gospel;
and, in defending them, plead the injured cause of Christ and
religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. This loving our neighbour as ourselves is farther illustrated
in this answer, by doing to others what we would have
them to do us. This is one of the most undeniable, and self-evident
truths contained in the law of nature. So that whatever
disputable matters there may be, as to what respects other
duties, this is allowed of by all mankind. Many, indeed, do
not conform their practice to this rule; which gives occasion
to the injuries done between man and man. However the
vilest of men, when they deliberate on their own actions, cannot
but blame themselves for acting contrary thereunto. Thus
Saul did, when he said unto David, <i>Thou art more righteous
than I; for thou hast rewarded me good; whereas I have rewarded
thee evil</i>, 1 Sam. xxiv. 17. Therefore we conclude,
that it is one of the first principles of the law of nature; and
may well be called, as it is in this answer, the sum of the Commandments
of the second table, or that, to which they are all
reduced. There are two things, which we shall lay down,
relating to this golden rule, of doing to others as we would
that they should do to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is miserably neglected by a great part of the world; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) By them who turn away their hearts from the afflicted;
so as not to pity, help, or endeavour to comfort them in their
distress. The Psalmist was of another mind, when he says,
<i>As for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I
humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned into
mine own bosom. I behaved myself as though he had been my
friend or brother. I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth
for his mother</i>, Psal. xxxv. 13,-15.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They who deny to others those natural, civil, or religious
liberties, which, by God’s appointment, they have a
right to, or envy them the possession thereof, may be said to
neglect this golden rule.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are farther to enquire, how this rule, of doing to
others what we would have them do to us, may be of use, in
order to our right observing the Commandments of the second
table?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> The fifth Commandment, which requires the performance
of all relative duties, would be better observed, did superiors
put themselves in the place of inferiors, and consider
what they would then expect from them; and the same they
ought to do to them. Again, the sixth, seventh, and eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>Commandments, that respect the life, honour, or wealth of
others; if these are dear to us, ought we not to consider, that
they are so to others; and if we would not be deprived of
them ourselves, how unreasonable is it for us to do any thing
that may tend to deprive others of them? Again, if, according
to the ninth Commandment, our good name be so valuable,
that we ought to maintain it, should not this rule be observed
by defamers, slanderers, and backbiters, who do that to others
which they would not have done to themselves? And the
tenth Commandment, which forbids our uneasiness at, or being
discontented with, the good of others, or endeavouring to
supplant, or divest them of the possession of what God has
given them in this world. This cannot be done by any one
who duly considers, how unwilling they would be to have
what they possess taken away, to satisfy the covetousness, or
lust, of others.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXXIII., CXXIV., CXXV., CXXVI., CXXVII., CXXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXIII.</span> <i>Which is the fifth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The fifth Commandment is, <i>Honour thy father and thy
mother, that thy days may be long upon the land, which the
Lord thy God giveth thee</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXIV.</span> <i>Who are meant by father, and mother, in the
fifth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> By father and mother, in the fifth Commandment, are
meant not only natural parents; but all the superiors in age,
and gifts, and especially such as by GOD’s ordinance, are
over us in place of authority, whether in family, church, or
common-wealth.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXV.</span> <i>Why are superiors styled, father and mother?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Superiors are styled father and mother, both to teach
them in all duties towards their inferiors, like natural parents,
to express love and tenderness to them, according to
their several relations, and to work inferiors to a greater
willingness and cheerfulness in performing their duties to
their superiors, as to their parents.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXVI.</span> <i>What is the general scope of the fifth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The general scope of the fifth Commandment, is, the
performance of those duties which we mutually owe in our
several relations, as inferiors, superiors, or equals.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXVII.</span> <i>What is the honour that inferiors owe to
their superiors?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The honour which inferiors owe to their superiors, is,
all due reverence, in heart, word, and behaviour; prayer,
and thanksgiving for them, imitation of their virtues and
graces; willing obedience to their lawful commands, and
counsels, due submission to their corrections, fidelity to, defence,
and maintenance of their persons and authority, according
to their several ranks, and the nature of their places;
bearing with their infirmities, and covering them in love,
that so they may be an honour to them and their government.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXVIII.</span> <i>What are the sins of inferiors against their
superiors?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins of inferiors against their superiors, are, all
neglect of the duties required towards them, envying at,
contempt of, and rebellion against their persons, and places,
in their lawful counsels, commands, and corrections, cursing,
mocking, and all such refractory and scandalous carriage,
as proves a shame and dishonour to them and their
government.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the fifth Commandment, no other relations are mentioned,
but father and mother; yet it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That, hereby, all superiors in general are intended; as
many others are called <i>fathers</i> in scripture, besides our natural
parents, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>1. Superiors in age. Thus it is said, <i>Rebuke not an elder,
but intreat him as a father, and the younger men as brethren;
the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all
purity</i>, 1 Tim. v. 1, 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They, are also called <i>fathers</i>, who are superior in gifts;
and accordingly have been the first inventors of arts, which
have been useful to the world. Thus Jabal is said to be <i>the
father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle</i>, Gen. iv. 20.
that is, the first that made considerable improvements in the
art of husbandry; and Jubal is said to be <i>the father</i>, that is,
the instructor <i>of all such as handle the harp and organ</i>, ver.
21. or the first that made improvements in the art of music.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Persons to whom we owe, under God, our outward prosperity
and happiness. In this sense Joseph, though a subject,
a young man, and a little before, a prisoner, is called <i>a father
to Pharaoh</i>, chap. xlv. 8. as he was an instrument to support
his greatness, and preserve him from the inconveniences of a
seven years famine.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>4. Princes, great men, and heads of families, are called
<i>fathers</i>. Thus Naaman was by his servants, 2 Kings v. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Men of honour and usefulness in the church are so called.
Thus when Elisha saw Elijah ascend into heaven, he cries
out, <i>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
thereof</i>, chap. ii. 12. And Joash, the king of Israel, used
the same expression to Elisha, <i>when fallen sick</i>, chap. xiii. 14.
And this is implied in the apostle’s styling those whom he had
been of use to, for their conviction, and enlightening in the
doctrines of the gospel, <i>My little children</i>, Gal. iv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Good kings and governors are called <i>fathers</i>. Thus it is
said, <i>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing
mothers</i>, Isa. xlix. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We have an account, in one of the answers we are explaining,
of the reason why superiors are styled father and
mother; namely, to denote, that they should behave towards
their inferiors, with that love and tenderness, as though they
were natural parents. Authority is not only consistent herewith,
but it ought to be exercised, by superiors towards inferiors,
in such a way. Thus Job, when in his prosperity, was,
as it were, a common father to all that were under him; accordingly
he says, <i>I delivered the poor that cried, and the
fatherless, and him that had none to help him</i>, Job xxix. 12.
upon which occasion he says, <i>I was a father to the poor</i>, ver.
16. And ministers, who, in some respects, are superior in
office to others; when their reproofs are mixed with tenderness
and compassion towards the souls of men under their care, are
compared to the nurse that <i>cherished her children</i>; as <i>being
affectionately desirous</i>, and <i>willing to impart to them, not the
gospel of God only, but also their own souls, as being dear to
them</i>, 1 Thess. ii. 7, 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We have, in another of the answers under our consideration,
an account of the general scope of the fifth Commandment;
and, as it requires the duties to be performed by every
one in their several relations; these are considered either as
superiors, inferiors, or equals. There are several sorts of relations
wherein persons are styled superior or inferior to one
another.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Such as are founded in nature; as that of parents and
children.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are such relations as are political, designed for
the good of mankind, living together as members of the same
common-wealth, in which every one has a right to his civil
liberties, which are to be enjoyed by one, and defended by
the other; of this sort is the relation of magistrates and subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. There is a relation founded in mutual compact and agreement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>respecting things to be done, on the one side, and gratifications
to be allowed, on the other; of this kind is the relation
between master and servant. The only difficulty that
arises from the account we have of the obligation of persons
to give honour to others, respects superiors honouring inferiors.
For the understanding of which, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That superiors are not obliged to shew the same marks
of honour to their inferiors, as inferiors are bound, by the
laws of God and nature, to express to them. Nevertheless,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There is a duty which the greatest owe to the least;
and there is also a degree of honour, which the lowest of men,
as reasonable creatures, or Christians, have put upon them by
God; and this is to be regarded by those who are, as to their
condition in the world, superior to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The meanest and lowest part of mankind, are, in many
respects, necessary and useful to those who are much their
superiors; and are to be regarded by them in proportion
thereto. And the performing the duties which such owe to
them, is called an honouring them.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We have, in another of the answers we are explaining,
an account of the honour which inferiors owe to their superiors.
Here it will be necessary for us to premise some things
concerning the measure of submission and obedience which
inferiors owe to superiors, of what kind soever the relation be.
As,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When the authority God has invested superiors with, is
abused, and the highest end of all sort of government, to wit,
the glory of God, and the good of mankind, can never be attained,
nor is, indeed, designed; or when the commands of
superiors contradict the commands of God, we are to obey
him rather than men, Acts iv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If we cannot obey the commands of superiors, as being
unjust, we must pray that God would interpose, direct, and
over-rule their authority, that it may not be abused by them;
or become a snare, or an occasion of sin, to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Though we cannot yield obedience to them, in those
things that are contrary to the laws of God, this does not discharge
us from our obligation to obey their commands, in other
things, agreeable thereunto; since we are not to suppose that
the abuse of their authority in some instances, divests them of
it in all respects.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We shall now proceed to consider the duties which inferiors
owe to their superiors. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That of children to parents. This is founded on the law
of nature, as under God, they derive their being from them;
and they are obliged thereunto, from a sense of gratitude for
that love, tenderness, and compassion which they have shewn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>to them. Therefore the apostle says, that <i>this is right</i>, Eph.
vi. 1. that is, equitable, and highly reasonable; and elsewhere,
that it is <i>well-pleasing unto the Lord</i>, Col. iii. 20. This duty
includes in it several things.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) They are sometimes to shew the regard they have to
them by outward tokens of respect. Thus Solomon, though
his character, as a king, rendered him superior to all his subjects;
yet he expressed a great deal of honour by outward
gestures to his mother; when she went to him to speak in the
behalf of Adonijah: it is said, that ‘the king rose up to meet
her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne,
and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she
sat on his right hand,’ 1 Kings ii. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They ought to be ready to do them any acts of service,
which are not unlawful or impossible, when commanded by
them. Thus Joseph obeyed Jacob, when he sent him to see
where his brethren were, and what they were engaged in,
Gen. xxxvii. 13. and David obeyed Jesse, when he sent him
to his brethren to the camp of Israel, 1 Sam. xvii. 17, 20.
This service is required more especially of them, while they
live with their parents, are maintained by them, and not, by
mutual compact, become servants to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Another duty which they owe, is, patient submission to
their just reproofs, design for their good. Thus the apostle
says, ‘We have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected us;
and we gave them reverence,’ Heb. xii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) They are to attend to, and comply with, their wholesome
advice and instruction. Thus it is said, <i>A wise son
heareth his father’s instruction</i>, Prov. xiii. 1. and, on the other
hand, he is branded with the character of a <i>fool</i> who <i>despiseth
it</i>, chap. xv. 5. and it is farther added, <i>He that regardeth reproof
is prudent</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Children are to express their duty to their parents, by
a thankful acknowledgment of past favours; and accordingly
ought to relieve them, if they are able, when their indigent
circumstances call for it; and endeavour to be a staff, comfort,
and support to them, in their old age. This is contained in
the message which Joseph sent to Jacob, when he invited him
to come down to him into Egypt, Gen. xlv. 9,-11. So when
Ruth bare a son to Boaz, her mother Naomi’s companions
blessed her, and said, <i>He shall be unto thee a restorer of thy
life, and a nourisher of thine old age</i>, Ruth iv. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) Children are to pay deference to, and, so far as it concerns
the glory of God, and their own future good, be advised,
by their parents, in disposing of themselves in marriage, or
any other important change of their condition and circumstances
in the world. Herein they acknowledge their authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>as superiors, and the care and concern which it is supposed
they naturally have for their welfare, as a part of themselves.
Moreover, by this they pay a deference to their wisdom and
judgment, as being superior in age, and probably, in wisdom,
as well as relation. And this ought to be done out of a sense of
gratitude for past favours received; and prudence will, for the
most part, dictate as much, especially when they depend on
them for present, or expect future advantages from them.
This is also an expedient to maintain love and peace in families,
which is oftentimes broken by the contrary practice. And
it may be farther recommended, from the laudable examples
hereof in good men; as Isaac, who submitted to the direction
of his father Abraham herein; and Jacob, Gen. xxiv. who was
determined by the consent of Laban, chap. xxix. Many more
instances might be given to the same purpose. And, on the
other hand, Esau’s contrary practice hereunto is recorded in
scripture, as a vile instance of disobedience; <i>which was a grief
of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah</i>, chap. xxvi. 35. And it
was, doubtless, an argument that he had no regard to God or
religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, this obligation is not without some exceptions;
for,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We do not speak of parents that are so far deprived of
judgment, that they are not fit to determine this matter; nor,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Such as have divested themselves of the natural affection
of parents, and entertaining an ungrounded prejudice
against some of their children, are endeavouring to expose
them to ruin, that they may shew more kindness to others.
These forfeit that right, which is otherwise founded in nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] If parents, by refusing to comply with the desire of
their children, plainly, in the judgment of the wisest of men,
obstruct their happiness, and the glory of God herein. Or, if
they have no reason for their not complying, or the reason
given is contrary to the laws of God, or the common sense of
all impartial judges; especially if the affair took its first rise
from them, and afterwards they changed their mind, without
sufficient ground. This, without doubt, lessens, or it may be
so circumstanced, that it wholly takes away the charge of sin
in the child, in acting contrary to the will of his parents, and
fastens the guilt on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] The case is vastly different, when applied to children
who are so far from being dependent on their parents, that
they depend on them. Nevertheless, in this case, some deference
and respect ought to be paid to them; and as it is the
children’s duty, it may be their interest so to do; since we
can hardly suppose, that parents, who depend on their children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>would oppose their happiness, in an affair that is apparently
contrary to their own interest, if they did not think that they
had sufficient reason for it; which ought to be duly weighed,
that it may be known, whether their advice is expedient to be
complied with, or no. And if in this, or any other instance,
children are obliged to act contrary to the will of their parents;
they ought to satisfy them, that it is not out of contempt to
their authority, but a conscientious regard to the glory of
God; and that it is conducive to their happiness, in the opinion
of the wisest and best of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall now consider the duty of servants to their masters.
This depends upon, and is limited by the contract,
which first brought them into that relation, the not fulfilling
whereof, renders them guilty of unfaithfulness. And it is no
less an instance of immorality, for them to rob them of that
time, which they have engaged to serve, than it is to take away
any part of their estate. But more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Servants ought to behave themselves, in their calling,
with industry, being as much concerned for their masters interest
as their own. Thus Joseph, though a foreigner, and one
who does not appear to have expected any reward for his service,
but a maintenance, served Potiphar. In the like manner
Jacob served Laban, though an unjust, severe and unrighteous
master. This may lead us to enquire concerning the duty of
servants, when their masters are froward, passionate, and unreasonable
in their demands, which renders their service very
irksome and unpleasant; but let it be considered in this case,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That, the master’s passion, which is his sin, ought not
to draw forth the corruption of his servant; for, sin indulged
by one, is no excuse for its being committed by another.
The apostle Peter supposes the case under our present consideration,
and gives this advice; <i>Servants be subject to your
masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also
to the froward</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If the master’s demands are unreasonable, the servant
must know the extent of his contract and obligation, which he
must, in justice, fulfil <i>as unto Christ</i>, Eph. vi. 5,-8. And,
as for those services that are reckoned unreasonable, and not
agreeable to the contract. These, if demanded, are rather to
be referred to the determination of others, since persons are
apt to be partial in judging in their own cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>There seems, indeed, to be an exception to this, in some instances,
which we find in scripture, of the unlimited obedience
of servants under the ceremonial law, which was not
founded in, nor the result of any contract between their masters
and them; accordingly we read, that persons became
servants,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span><i>1st</i>, Through poverty; by reason of which, they sold themselves
for the payment of debts. In this case there was a
kind of contract, indeed; and the service to be performed
ought, (pursuant to the law of God and nature,) to have been
agreeable to, and adjusted by the value of the debt contracted.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2d</i>, Prisoners taken in war, were treated as servants, and,
as such, sold to others. In this case, all the children that
were born to them, during their servitude, were the property
of the master; and these are called home-born servants, who
had not so much liberty allowed them as when they were
servants by mutual compact, as is most common among us; in
which case both parties are bound by this agreement.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We proceed to consider the duty of the members of a
common-wealth, or body-politic, to their lawful magistrates,
as the apostle says, <i>Let every soul be subject unto the higher
powers</i>, Rom. xiii. 1. Here we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The necessity and the end of civil government. This
will appear, if we consider mankind in general, as prone to be
influenced by those passions, which are not entirely under the
conduct of reason, and, if no check were given to them, would
prove injurious to societies. We may also observe, that God
has, in his law, ordained certain punishments to be inflicted,
with a design to restrain those corruptions, and to keep the
world in order. And that this end may more effectually be
answered, it is necessary, that some should be set over others,
to administer justice, in chastising the guilty, and defending
the innocent; otherwise the world would be filled with confusion,
and men would commit sin with impunity; and more
resemble brute creatures than those that are endowed with
reason, and as such, capable of moral government; as it is said
when <i>there was no king in Israel, every man did that which
was right in his own eyes</i>, Judges xxi. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>We proceed now to consider the advantage of civil government.
It is in itself a blessing to mankind, when it does not
degenerate into tyranny. So that good magistrates are a great
instance of divine favour to a nation; as the queen of Sheba
said to Solomon, <i>Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy
servants which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to
set thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God. Because
thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice</i>, 2
Chron. ix. 7, 8. And it is included among the blessings of
the gospel-state, that <i>kings should be their nursing fathers, and
their queens their nursing mothers</i>, Isa. xlix. 23. Such are
said, as David was, to be <i>raised up, to fulfil the will of God</i>,
Acts xiii. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>Nevertheless, civil government may be so administered,
that it may cease to be a blessing to the subjects. Thus
Samuel describes the miserable estate of a people, whose kings
endeavour to establish their own greatness by enslaving and
plundering their subjects <i>taking their sons</i> and <i>daughters</i> by
force, to be their servants; seizing their <i>fields</i>, their <i>vineyards
and olive-yards, and the tenth of their increase</i>; which would
oblige them to <i>cry unto the Lord, because of their oppression</i>,
1 Sam. viii. 11,-18. And we have an instance of this in
Rehoboam, who was herein as remarkable for his want of
conduct, as his father was for his excelling wisdom. His
rough and ill-timed answer to his subjects, in which gave
them to expect nothing else but oppression and slavery, issued
in the revolt of the ten tribes from his government, 1 Kings
xii. 13, 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this different method of the administration of civil
government, whereby it rendered either a blessing or an affliction
to the subjects; we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That when that which is in itself a blessing, is turned
into a curse, this may be looked upon as a punishment inflicted
by God, for the iniquity of a people. Thus he says, <i>I gave
thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in wrath</i>, Hosea
xiii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We have great reason to be well-pleased with, and to
bless God for the government we are under, as not being exposed
to the slavery that some other nations are; who have
no laws, but what result from the arbitrary will of their prince;
and who can call nothing they have their own. This should
make us prize the liberties we enjoy; and be a strong motive
to us to give due and cheerful obedience to our rightful and
lawful sovereign, and all magistrates under him, who rule in
righteousness, and are a terror to evil doers, but a praise to
them that do well.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This affords matter of reproof to the restless tempers
of those, who are under the mildest government; which is administered
beyond all reasonable exception, our enemies themselves
being judges, who would confess the same, were they
not blinded with prejudice; which puts them upon betaking
themselves to railery, instead of better arguments. These are
reproved by the apostle, who speaks of some <i>that walk after
the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.
Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak
evil, even of dignities</i>, 2 Pet. ii. 10. This leads us</p>

<p class='c006'>To consider the honour that subjects owe to their lawful
magistrates. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, They are highly to resent, and endeavour, in their several
stations and capacities, to check the insolence of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>make bold with the character, and take the liberty to reproach
their magistrates in common conversation; which is directly
contrary to the law of God; that says, <i>Curse not the king, no,
not in thy thought, and curse not the rich in thy bed-chamber.
For a bird of the air shall carry the voice; and that which hath
wings shall tell the matter</i>, Eccles. x. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We are to support the honour of government, by paying
those tributes which are lawfully exacted. Thus the apostle
says, <i>Render to all their due; tribute to whom tribute is due,
custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom
honour</i>, Rom. xiii. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We are to pray for a blessing from God, on the administration
of our civil governors, that it may be under the
divine direction, and tend to answer the great ends of government,
viz. the glory of God, and the welfare of the subject.
And here I cannot but observe, that no one on earth
has a power of discharging subjects from their obedience to
their lawful governors, who endeavour to rule them according
to the laws of God and nature, and those fundamental constitutions
that are agreeable thereto. Therefore it is a most detestable
position advanced by the Papists, that the pope has a
power to excommunicate and depose sovereign princes; though
it does not appear that he has received any such authority
from Christ, but herein intermeddles with a province that does
not belong to him. For princes do not receive their crowns
from him; and therefore are not to be deposed by him. In
opposition hereunto, it may be alleged,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That this is directly contrary to the temper of the blessed
Jesus, and of the apostles, and primitive Christians; who
did not encourage their followers to depose Heathen kings
and emperors; but on the other hand, exhorted them to <i>submit
to them in all things</i>, consistent with the glory of God, and
the good of mankind; <i>not only for wrath, but for conscience
sake</i>, ver. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The church has no temporal sword committed to her,
all its censures being spiritual. Temporal punishments are
left in the hands of the civil magistrate; concerning whom,
the apostle says, that <i>he is the minister of God to thee for good.
But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not
the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doth evil</i>, ver. 4. On the other
hand, when speaking concerning those, who have the government
of ecclesiastical matters committed to them, he says,
<i>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
God, to the pulling down of strong holds</i>, 2 Cor. x. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>The arguments generally used by the Papists, to support
the cause of rebellion, and their usurped power to depose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>magistrates, who are not of their communion, are very weak,
and most of them, such as may easily be answered; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When they allege the commission given by Christ, to
Peter, <i>Feed my sheep</i>, John xxi. 17. They pretend, that to
feed, is the same as to govern; and that this implies a power
of punishing; which they suppose to be so far extended, as
that the bishop of Rome may depose sovereign princes, as occasion
offers; and that this power was given to Peter and his
successors, which the popes of Rome pretend to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that this commission given
by Christ to Peter, to <i>feed his sheep</i>, imports his feeding them
with knowledge and understanding, and not lording it over
God’s heritage. Thus our Saviour says, <i>The kings of the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise
authority over them, are called benefactors. But ye shall not
be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the
younger; and he that is chief as he that doth serve</i>, Luke xxii.
25, 26. Moreover, their pretence that the bishops of Rome
are Peter’s successors, contains a claim of what they have not
the least shadow of right to; and is, indeed, to place them in
Peter’s chair, who are the greatest opposers of his doctrine.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another argument they bring, tending to overthrow the
power of the civil magistrate, is, that, as the soul is more excellent
than the body, and its welfare to be preferred in proportion
thereunto; so the church is to take care of the spiritual
concerns of mankind, to which all temporal concerns are to
give place; therefore its power is greater than that of the civil
magistrate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that this similitude does
not prove the thing for which it is brought; and though it be
allowed, that the soul is more excellent than the body; yet its
welfare is not to be secured by inflicting corporal punishments,
such as persecutions and massacres; which, to abate and encourage,
is to cast a reproach on religion; and it will tend
very much to weaken the interest of Christ in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the magistrate is ordained by God, to defend
the religious as well as civil liberties of his subjects; which is
included in the apostle’s exhortation; let prayers be made <i>for
kings and for all in authority; that we may lead a peaceable
and quiet life in all godliness and honesty</i>, 1 Tim. ii. 2. and
elsewhere we are exhorted, to <i>submit to governors, as unto
them who are sent by the Lord, for the punishment of evil doers,
and for the praise of them that do well</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. There is another argument which they make use of, taken
from Azariah the priest’s opposing king Uzziah, for intruding
himself into the priest’s office, in burning incense in the
temple. Thus it is said, in 1 Chron. xxvi. 16-18. that ‘when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction. For
he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the
temple of the Lord, to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him four-score
priests of the Lord, that were valiant men. And they
withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth
not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but
to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn
incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed,
neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God.’ To
support their argument, taken from this scripture, they observe,
that the priests, who went in with Azariah, are said to
be <i>valiant men</i>, and so ready to commit any hostilities against
the king. Azariah also threatens him, when he tells him, <i>It
should not be for his honour</i>; and peremptorily commands him,
to be gone out of the temple. This they suppose, is a flagrant
instance of the power of the church over the civil magistrate,
in all those things that interfere with what is sacred.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>1st</i>,) That Uzziah’s sin, according to the law of that dispensation,
was very great, and against an express command of
God, who had ordered, that none should officiate in the priest’s
office, but those who were of the family of Aaron.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>2dly</i>,) Azariah, and the rest of the priests, did not attempt
to depose him, but to prevent his going on in his sin; which
would not be for his honour, as the high-priest tells him. And
this he says, not in a menacing way, as signifying that he
would inflict some punishment on him; but as declaring what
God would do against him, that would tend to his dishonour
for this sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>3dly</i>,) Though the high-priest, in God’s name, commanded
him to go out of the sanctuary; yet he did not lay violent
hands on him, at least, till the leprosy was seen upon him.
Ver. 27. ‘And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests
looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead,
and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted
also to go out, because the Lord had smitten him.’ This
they did, because a leper was not, according to the law of
God, to enter into the congregation, inasmuch as he would defile
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>4thly</i>,) He was not properly deposed; but, by this plague
of leprosy, rendered incapable of reigning; and therefore ‘he
lived alone,’ ver. 21. ‘in a several house, being a leper; for
he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Jotham his
son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.’
This was agreeable to the law of God, touching the leper, in
which it is said, that ‘all the days wherein the plague shall be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>in him, he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone,
without the camp shall his habitation be,’ Lev. xiii. 46.
It may farther be observed, that his son managed the affairs
of the kingdom for him; so that the use which is made by the
Papists of this scripture, to give countenance to their doctrine
of deposing princes, is foreign to the true sense thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There is one more scripture-example which the Papists
bring, whereby they defend their practice, not only of deposing,
but murdering princes; and that is in 2 Kings xi. 15.
<i>But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
the officers of the host, and said unto them, have her forth
without the ranges; and him that followeth her, kill with the
sword. For the priest had said, let her not be slain in the
house of the Lord.</i> But to this it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'>[<i>1st</i>,] That Athaliah was plainly an usurper, not only by
reason of her sex, since a woman was not to reign over Israel,
or Judah: But she killed all the seed royal, to establish herself
in the throne, except Joash, who escaped, being hid from
her fury, in an apartment belonging to the temple, 2 Chron.
xxii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>[<i>2dly</i>,] What Jehoiada did in deposing her, was not only
with a good design to set up the lawful heir; but it was done
by an express command of the Lord, chap. xxiii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>[<i>3dly</i>,] Joash was proclaimed, and anointed, and universally
owned as king by the people, before Athaliah was slain, 2
Kings xi. 12,-14.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. We are now to consider the sins of inferiors against
their superiors. These are expressed in general terms, in one
of the answers we are explaining; namely, neglecting the duties
we owe to them, envying at, and contempt of their persons,
places, and lawful counsels and commands, and all refractory
carriage, that may prove a shame and dishonour to
their government; but, more particularly, inferiors sin against
their superiors.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In divulging their secrets; and that either as to what respects
the affairs of their families, or their secular callings in
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In mocking, reproaching, or exposing their infirmities.
Thus it is said, <i>The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth
to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
and the young eagles shall eat it</i>, Prov. xxx. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In endeavouring to make disturbance or disorders in families,
or the common-wealth, through discontent with their
station as inferiors, or a desire to rule over those to whom they
ought to be in subjection.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Servants sin, in neglecting to fulfil their contract, or do
the service which they engaged to perform, when they first entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>into that relation. Or when they are only disposed to
perform the duties incumbent on them, when they are under
their master’s eye, having no sense of common justice, or their
obligation to approve themselves to God, in performing the duties
they owe to man. Thus the apostle exhorts servants, to
<i>be obedient to them which are their masters, with fear and
trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ. Not with eye-service,
as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the
will of God from the heart</i>, Eph. vi. 5, 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Children sin, by being unnatural to their parents, who
refuse or neglect to maintain them if they need it, especially
when they are aged; whereby they will appear to have no
sense of gratitude, for past favours, nor regard to that duty
which nature obliges them to perform.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>Quest. CXXIX., CXXX., CXXXI., CXXXII., CXXXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXIX.</span> <i>What is required of superiors towards their
inferiors?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> It is required of superiors, according to that power
they receive from God, and that relation wherein they stand,
to love, pray for, and bless their inferiors; to instruct, counsel,
and admonish them; countenancing, commending, and
rewarding such as do well; discountenancing, reproving, and
chastising such as do ill; protecting, and providing for them
all things necessary for soul, and body; and by grave, wise,
holy, and exemplary carriage, to procure glory to God, honour
to themselves, and so to preserve the authority which
God hath put upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXX.</span> <i>What are the sins of superiors?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins of superiors are, beside the neglect of the duties
required of them, and inordinate seeking of themselves,
their own glory, ease, profit, or pleasure; commanding things
unlawful, or not in the power of inferiors to perform; counselling,
encouraging, or favouring them in that which is evil,
dissuading, discouraging, or discountenancing them in that
which is good; correcting them unduly, careless exposing,
or leaving them to wrong, temptation, and danger; provoking
them to wrath; or any way dishonouring themselves, or
lessening their authority, by an unjust, indiscreet, rigorous,
or remiss behaviour.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXI.</span> <i>What are the duties of equals?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties of equals are, to regard the dignity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>worth of each other, in giving honour to go one before another,
and to rejoice in each others gifts and advancement, as
in their own.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXII.</span> <i>What are the sins of equals?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins of equals are, beside the neglect of the duties
required, the undervaluing of the worth, envying the
gifts, grieving at the advancement or prosperity one of another,
and usurping pre-eminence one over another.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXIII.</span> <i>What is the reason annexed to the fifth
Commandment the more to enforce it?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The reason annexed to the fifth Commandment, in
these words, [<i>That thy days may be long upon the land,
which the Lord thy God giveth thee</i>] is an express promise
of long life and prosperity, as far as it shall serve for God’s
glory, and their own good, to all such as keep this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c012'>1. We are to consider the duties which superiors owe to
their inferiors. Whatever circumstance of advancement
one has above another in the world, this is a peculiar gift
of God, and should not give occasion to that pride of heart
which is natural to fallen man, which puts him upon casting
contempt on those who are below him; much less should they
oppress others, who are in a lower station of life than themselves;
but should endeavour to do good to them, and thereby
glorify God. And, indeed, as every relation is mutual, and
calls for its respective duties, so that superiors expect the duty
which belongs to them, from inferiors; it is equally just and
reasonable that they should not neglect those duties which they
are obliged to perform to them; though they be of another nature,
different from those which they demand from them.
Here we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The duty of parents to children. This not only includes
in it the using their utmost endeavours to promote their worldly
advantage, as to what respects their present or future condition
in life; but they ought to have a just concern for their
spiritual welfare, which is a duty very much neglected, though
it be incumbent on all parents, and will be performed by those
who have a sense of God and religion upon their spirits; this
the apostle calls <i>bringing them up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord</i>, Eph. vi. 4. When children are first capable
of being instructed; or when they first take in the knowledge
of common things; then it is the parent’s duty to instil into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>them those things that are spiritual. It is, indeed, a difficult
matter to speak to them about divine things, so as to lead them
into the knowledge thereof; and it requires a great measure
of wisdom and faithfulness in them. One of the first duties
that they owe to them, is acknowledging God’s right to them,
putting them under his care, giving them up to him, hoping
and trusting in Christ, that he will bestow on them the saving
blessings of the covenant of grace, and that in their early age
of life. Moreover, since children soon discover themselves to
have a corrupt nature: This ought to be checked and fenced
against, as much as it is in our power: Since all habits of sin
are of an increasing nature, and though it be difficult to prevent
them; yet we shall find it much more so to root them
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we may instil into the minds of children, the principles
of religion, as soon as they are capable of receiving instruction,
let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That parents must take great care that they neither
speak nor act any thing before their children, which may tend
to corrupt their minds, or afford a bad example, which it would
be of pernicious consequence to them to follow; nor ought
they to suffer those passions to break forth, which may render
them mean and contemptible in the eyes of their children; or
give them occasion, by their example, to indulge the same passions.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They must take heed that they do not exercise severity
for trifles, or those inadvertencies which children are chargeable
with, on the one hand; nor too much indulge them in
that incorrigibleness and profaneness which they sometimes
see in them, on the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They must separate from them all companions, or servants,
from whom they may imbibe the principles of sin, and
oblige those who have the immediate care of their education,
to instil into them the principles of religion, and, at the same
time, to recommend to them, the pleasure, beauty, and advantage
of holiness in all, but especially in young ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The examples which we have, either in scripture, or
our own observation in the world, of those who have devoted
themselves to God, and been religious betimes, is to be frequently
inculcated, for their imitation, with all the affecting
and moving expressions that it is possible for them to use, and
with a particular application thereof to their case; and, on the
other hand, the miserable consequences which have attended
persons neglecting to embrace the ways of God in the days of
their youth, and the sore judgments which often ensue hereupon;
as it is said, <i>His bones are full of the sin of youth</i>, Job
xx. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>(5.) Reproofs for sin are to be given, with a zeal and concern
for the glory of God; and yet with that affection as may
convince children, that in those things, in which they are ready
to think their parents their enemies, they appear to be their
greatest friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) They, who have the care of children, ought to take heed,
that they do not lead them into, or give them occasion, to rest
in, a formal, or external appearance of religion, on the one
hand; nor, on the other hand, are they to use any methods
which may induce them to think, that, a burden, or a reproach,
which they ought to esteem their delight and honour.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) Those opportunities are more especially to be embraced,
when instructions are most likely to be regarded by them; as
when they are inquisitive about divine things. This should
give the parent occasion to be particular in explaining them to
them. Thus God commands Israel, <i>when thy son asketh thee
in time to come, what mean the testimonies and the statutes, and
the judgments; which the Lord thy God commanded you?</i> to
<i>say unto him, we were Pharaoh’s bondsmen</i>, Deut. vi. 20, 21.
and so they were to relate to them those dispensations of providence
towards them, that gave occasion to these statutes
which he had appointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>(8.) Parents should let their children know, that their obedience
to God’s commands, will always entitle them to the
greatest share in their affection, that this may be a motive and
inducement thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider the duty which masters owe to
their servants. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) They ought to recommend the good ways of God to
them, endeavouring to persuade them to be religious; and, by
their exemplary conversation in their families, whereby they
adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, in all things, afford
them an additional motive hereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They should encourage religion in their servants, as
well as diligence and industry. For, as the one tends to their
advantage, to whom their service is due; the other tends to
the glory of God, and the good of their souls, who are found
in the practice of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Masters should endeavour to instruct their servants in
the principles of religion, especially if ignorant. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) They should allow them sufficient time for religious duties;
which, if needful, ought to be taken out of that time,
wherein they would otherwise be employed in their service:
And this they ought to do, as considering, that the best Christians
are like to make the most faithful servants.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are now to consider the duty of magistrates towards
their subjects. This consists,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>(1.) In their endeavouring to promote their liberty, safety,
and happiness, by the justice and clemency of their administration.
Thus it is said, <i>He that ruleth over men must be just,
ruling in the fear of God</i>, 2 Sam. xxiii. 3. By this means they
will lay their subjects under the highest obligation to duty and
obedience; and the respect which they have from them, will
render the station, in which they are, more agreeable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They ought to defend the rights of subjects, when injured,
against their oppressors; that they may appear to be,
as it were, their common fathers, to whom they have recourse
in all difficulties, and find redress.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They ought to encourage and support the common design
of Christianity, by suppressing irreligion and profaneness,
and every thing which is a scandal to the Christian name, or
a reproach to a well-ordered government. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider the sins of superiors. These sin in their
behaviour towards their inferiors,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. By pride and haughtiness; when they treat those who
are below them, with contempt and disdain; as though, because
they are not, in many respects, their equals, they are not their
fellow-creatures. This discovers itself either in reproachful
words or actions. Thus the Pharisees treated those whom
they apprehended inferior to them, in gifts or station, in the
church, with contempt; so that they often made use of that
aphorism; <i>This people, who knoweth not the law, are cursed</i>,
John vii. 49.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another sin of superiors is, when masters exact severe
and unmerciful labour, beyond what is reasonable, of their servants,
which is little better than the oppression of the Egyptian
task-masters; who commanded them to make brick without
straw, Exod. v. 15,16. and beat, and dealt severely with them,
because they could not fulfil their unreasonable exactions.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Sin is committed by those who, being princes, or generals,
exercise inhuman cruelty, contrary to the law of nature
and nations, towards their conquered enemies, when they have
them in their power. This David seems to have been charged
with, as a blemish in his reign; when he <i>put</i> the men of
Rabbah, after he had conquered them, <i>under saws, and under
harrows of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kilns.
Thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon</i>; which
seems hardly justifiable by marshal law; and therefore it must
be reckoned a failing in him; especially unless the Ammonites
had done something extraordinary, to deserve such treatment,
or had used Israel in the like manner, so that this might be
reckoned a just reprizal upon them, 2 Sam. xii. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that magistrates do not behave to
their subjects, as they ought, and therefore commit sin, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>they inflict punishment beyond what the law directs, or the
crime deserves. Thus small offences are not to be punished
with death, as capital crimes are, since the punishment must
be greater or less, in proportion to the crime. Thus God enjoined
a certain number of stripes for some crimes committed,
which they were not to exceed; <i>whereby their brother would
seem vile unto them</i>, Deut. xxv. 2, 3. that is, they would treat
him with a greater severity than the nature of the crime demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Superiors sin, when they take advantage on the necessities
of the poor; in buying or selling, which is called, a <i>grinding
the faces of the poor</i>, Isa. iii. 14, 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Masters, or parents sin, in giving undue correction to
their servants or children, for small faults as when they neglect
to perform some punctilio’s, of respect, which are due to
them, with greater severity than they do, open sins against
God, or when they are transported with unreasonable passion
for trifles; whereby they render themselves hated by them,
and provoke them to wrath, rather than answer the end of
chastisement, which is the glory of God and their good. This
the apostle forbids parents to do, Eph. vi. 4. And elsewhere,
he speaks of the <i>fathers of our flesh chastizing us after their
own pleasure</i>, Heb. xii. 10. as being disagreeable to the divine
dispensations, and consequently not to be justified in them that
practise it.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Superiors sin, when they command those things, of their
inferiors, which are in themselves sinful, which they cannot,
in their consciences, comply with. And to this we may add,
their demanding those things which are impossible, and being
enraged against them for not doing them.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Superiors sin, when they surmise their inferiors have
committed a fault, which they resent, and punish, without suffering
them to vindicate themselves, though they request this
favour in the most submissive way. This is to extend their
authority beyond the bounds of reason. We shall now consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The duty of equals. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. They ought to encourage and strengthen the hands of one
another in the ways of God, which is the great end and design
of Christian societies.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They ought to sympathize with one another in their
weakness, warning and helping each other, when exposed to
temptations, or overcome by them.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They ought to defend one another when reproached by
the enemies of God and religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. To love one another, and rejoice in each others welfare
And,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>5. To withdraw from the society of those who are a reproach
to, or endeavour to turn them aside from the good ways of
God.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall now consider the sins of equals; which they
are guilty of,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When they entertain unjust and unfriendly quarrels, contrary
to that love, which ought to be amongst brethren.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When they affect, or usurp pre-eminence over one another;
as Diotrephes did, whom the apostle speaks of, who
<i>loved to have the pre-eminence amongst them</i>, 3 John, ver. 9.
Christ’s disciples themselves were sometimes liable to this
charge; especially when <i>there was a strife among them, which
of them should be accounted greatest</i>, Luke xxii. 24. which our
Saviour is so far from commending in them, that he reproves
them for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is a great sin, when equals endeavour to make breaches
amongst those, who are otherwise inclined to live peaceably
with one another. This is the wretched employment of tale-bearers,
busy-bodies, make-bates, and slanderers, who delight
to raise and propagate false reports; as the Psalmist supposes
some inclined to do, who are distinguished from those who do
not <i>backbite with their tongue</i>, nor <i>take up a reproach against
their neighbour</i>, &amp;c. Psal. xv. 3. and it is reckoned one of
those things which the Lord hates, Prov. vi. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. They are guilty of sin, when they insult, and take occasion,
to expose their brethren, for those weaknesses and infirmities
which they see in them, not considering that they are
also liable to the same themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. When they endeavour to ensnare and entice others to
sin. This vile practice Solomon takes notice of, chap. i. 10,
15. and cautions those who are thus tempted against consenting
to, or complying with them. We are now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>V. The reasons annexed to the fifth Commandment, which
are included in that promise of long life, to such as keep it.
It is enquired by some, whether this promise is to be applied
to none but the Israelites; since there is mention of the land
which the Lord gave them, to wit, Canaan? To which it may
be replied; that though they might make a particular application
of it to themselves; yet it extends to men in all ages and
places. Accordingly the apostle Paul mentioning this Commandment,
and the promise annexed to if, instead of those
words, <i>That thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord
thy God giveth thee</i>, alters the mode of expression, that it may
be applicable to us as well as them, when he says, <i>That thou
mayest live long on the earth</i>, Eph. vi. 2, 3. This may give
us occasion to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Whether this promise be made good as to the letter of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>to all that keep this Commandment; especially since we find,
that, according to the common methods of providence, some
good men live but a short time in this world, when the wicked
oftentimes live to a great age. That the lives of some good
men have been short, needs not be proved. Abijah, the best
of Jeroboam’s family, in whom some good thing was found,
towards the Lord God of Israel, died when a child, 1 Kings
xiv. 12, 13. And Josiah, who was one of the best of the kings
that reigned over Judah, lived but thirty nine years; for it is
said, that <i>he was eight years old when he began to reign; and
he reigned thirty and one years</i>, 2 Kings xxii. 1. And Enoch
excelled all the patriarchs who lived before the flood, and was
more honoured in that he was translated to heaven, without
dying; yet he continued but a little while in this world, if we
compare the time he lived here, with the time which men generally
lived before the deluge; which was but <i>three hundred and
sixty five years</i>; whereas, several others are said to have lived
above nine hundred years. And Joseph, who was the most
remarkable, for shewing honour to parents, and performing the
duties belonging to other relations, of any we read of in scripture;
he lived but an <i>hundred and ten years</i>, Gen. l. 26.
Whereas Levi, who had been a reproach to his father, and a
dishonour to the family in general, lived an <i>hundred thirty and
seven years</i>, Exod. vi. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall now consider, how such dispensations of providence
may be accounted for, consistently with the promise annexed
to this Commandment. Accordingly it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That, when God takes his saints out of the world when
young, it is sometimes a peculiar instance of compassion to
them, in taking them from the evil to come. Thus Josiah died,
as was but now hinted, when young; but this was in mercy to
him, that he might not see the evil which God would bring on
Judah for their sins, 2 Kings xxii. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They are, at their death, possessed of a better world,
which is the best exchange: So that were the matter referred
to their own choice, they would choose heaven before the longest
life, and the best advantages they can enjoy in this world.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Old age is not a blessing, unless it be adorned with
grace. <i>The hoary head is</i>, indeed, <i>a crown of glory, if it be
found in the way of righteousness</i>, Prov. xvi. 13. but not
otherwise. Good men are not destroyed by the blast of God’s
wrath, but gathered, like a shock of corn, when fully ripe; they
are meet for, and then received into a better world. Therefore
<i>the child</i> dying in Christ, is said <i>to die an hundred years
old</i>, Isa. lxv. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>3. We shall now enquire, how far, or in what respects, we
are to hope for, and desire the accomplishment of the promises
of temporal good things.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Temporal good things are not to be desired ultimately
for themselves, but as subservient to the glory of God. And
long life in particular is a blessing, so far as it affords more
space to do service to the interest of Christ in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They are to be desired, with an entire submission to
the will of God, and a resolution to acknowledge, that he is
righteous, and to magnify his name, though he deny them to
us, as considering that he knows what is best for us, and may
do what he will with his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to desire that God would give us temporal good
things in mercy, as pledges of eternal happiness, and not in
wrath. Thus the Psalmist says; <i>There be many that say, who
will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance
upon us</i>, Psal. iv. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. We shall now enquire with what frame of spirit we ought
to bear the loss of temporal good things, which we have been
encouraged by God’s promise, to hope for. In answer to this,
let it be considered, that if God does not fulfil his promise in
the way and manner which we expect, in granting us temporal
good things; yet,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We must justify him, and condemn ourselves; none
can say, that he does not forfeit all blessings daily. Therefore
we are to say; let God be true, and every man a liar. He is
a God of infinite faithfulness; but we are unfaithful, and not
stedfast in his covenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are not to conclude, that our being deprived of
temporal good things, which we expect, is a certain sign that
we have no right to, or interest in those better things that accompany
salvation; as the wise man says, <i>No man knoweth
either love or hatred, by all that is before him</i>, Eccles. ix. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to reckon the loss of temporal good things as
a trial of our faith and patience; and endeavour, under such
disappointments, to make it appear, that the world was not the
main thing we had in view; but Christ and spiritual blessings
in him, were the spring of all our religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. It may farther be enquired; what are those things that
tend to make a long life happy, for which alone it is to be desired?
It may be observed, that life is sometimes attended
with those miseries, which induce a believer to desire to depart,
and be with Christ, as the weary traveller desires rest.
And it may be observed, that though, in the promise annexed
to the fifth Commandment, we have no mention of any thing
but long life; yet the apostle, when explaining it, adds, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>they shall have a prosperous life; without which, long life
would not be so great a blessing. Thus he says, <i>That it may
be well with thee, and thou mayest live long upon the earth</i>,
Eph. vi. 3. Now there are three things which tend to make
a long life happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Experience of growth in grace, in proportion to our
advances in age, according to that promise, <i>They shall bring
forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing</i>, Psal.
xcii. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When we retain our natural abilities, and that strength
and vigour of mind, which we have formerly had. This some
are deprived of, through the infirmities of old age; whereby
they may be said to out-live themselves. It was a peculiar
blessing, which God granted to Moses; concerning whom it
is said, that <i>he was an hundred and twenty years old when he
died</i>; and yet <i>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</i>,
Deut. xxxiv. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Old age is a blessing, when our usefulness to others,
in our day and generation, is continued. Thus Joshua died
an old man; but it was a peculiar blessing that he was useful
to the end; for in the very close of his life he <i>made a covenant
with the people in Shechem</i>, Josh. xxiv. 25. compared with 29.
and laid strict commands on them, to behave themselves towards
God, as they ought to do.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXIV.</span> <i>What is the sixth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sixth Commandment is, [<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>.]</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXV.</span> <i>What are the duties required in the sixth
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the sixth Commandment are,
all careful studies, and lawful endeavours to preserve the
life of ourselves, and others, by resisting all thoughts and
purposes, subduing all passions, and avoiding all occasions,
temptations, and practices, which tend to the unjust taking
away the life of any; by just defence thereof against violence,
patient bearing of the hand of God, quietness of mind, cheerfulness
of spirit, a sober use of meat, drink, physic, sleep,
labour, and recreations, by charitable thoughts, love, compassion,
meekness, gentleness, kindness, peaceable, mild, and
courteous speeches and behaviour, forbearance, readiness to
be reconciled, patient bearing and forgiving of injuries, and
requiting good for evil, comforting and succouring the distressed,
and protecting and defending the innocent.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span><span class='sc'>Quest. CXXXVI.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the sixth
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the sixth Commandment are,
all taking away the life of ourselves, or of others, except in
case of public justice, lawful war, or necessary defence; the
neglecting or withdrawing the lawful and necessary means
of preservation of life, sinful anger, hatred, envy, desire of
revenge, all excessive passions, distracting cares, immoderate
use of meat, drink, labour, and recreations; provoking
words, oppressing, quarrelling, striking, wounding, and
whatsoever else tends to the destruction of the life of any.</p>

<p class='c012'>In explaining this Commandment, we are,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To consider the positive part thereof, or the duties required
in it, namely, that we should use all lawful endeavours
to preserve our own life, and the life of others; and consequently
we should avoid all those passions, and other things,
which may afford an occasion to take it away, and live in the
constant exercise of the duties of temperance and sobriety, as
to what respects ourselves; meekness, gentleness, and forgiving
injuries, as to what concerns others.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this Commandment it is supposed, that life is the most
valuable blessing of nature; and therefore to take it away, is
to do the utmost injury that can be attempted against us. The
valuableness of the life of man appears in four things.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is the result of the union of the soul with the body,
which is the principle of those actions that are put forth by us
as intelligent creatures; and therefore life is to be esteemed in
proportion to the excellency thereof; which, is the noblest part
of the creation, angels excepted.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Nothing can compensate or satisfy for the taking away
the life of man, how much satisfaction soever may be given
for the loss of other things.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We may observe, that man, in this respect, is the subject
of the divine image; which supposes us to have a more excellent
life than any other creatures in this lower world; and
it is assigned as a reason of our obligation to preserve it, Gen.
ix. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Life is given and continued to us, that hereby the most
valuable ends may be attained, conducive to the glory of God,
the advancement of religion in the world, and promoting our
everlasting happiness. From whence we may take an estimate
of its excellency; and it contains the highest motive to
us, to yield obedience, to this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>This leads us to consider the means which we are to use,
to preserve our own lives, and the lives of others. As to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>what respects the preservation of our own life; we are not to
rush presumptuously into danger of death, without a divine
warrant, for that is to be prodigal of life. We are also to exercise
sobriety and temperance, avoiding gluttony, drunkenness,
lust, and all exorbitant passions, which tend to impair
the health, as well as defile the conscience. Moreover, when
occasion requires it, we are to have recourse to the skill of
physicians, and make use of those proper medicines, that may
conduce to repair the weakness and decays of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what concerns our endeavours to preserve the lives
of others; we are to caution them against those things, which
would tend to destroy their health, and, by degrees, their
lives. And we must also discover and detect all secret plots
and contrivances which may be directed against them; and we
are to support and relieve those who are ready to perish by
extreme poverty; yea, though they were our enemies, Rom.
xii. 20. Job xxxi, 19, 20, 22. We are also to defend them
who are in imminent danger of death, Psal. lxxxii. 3, 4. Prov.
xxiv. 11, 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, we must not use unwarrantable means, though
it were to save our own lives. As, in times of persecution,
we are not to renounce the truths of God, or give occasion to
the common enemy, to revile, or speak evil of them, to avoid
suffering for the cause thereof. This was that noble principle
by which the martyrs, whom the apostle speaks of, were acted;
<i>They were tortured, not accepting deliverance</i>, Heb. xi. 35.
that is, when they were exposed to the most exquisite torments,
and their lives offered them, in case they would deny
Christ, they would not accept deliverance on so dishonourable
terms. Neither are we, at any time, to tell a lye, or act that
which is contrary to truth, though it were to save our lives.
This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider the sins forbidden in this Commandment;
and these are either the taking away of life, or doing that
which has a tendency thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is unlawful to take away the life of another. But this
is to be considered with some exceptions, or limitations.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) This may be done in lawful wars. Thus we read of
many wars begun and carried on, and much blood shed therein,
by God’s direction, and with his approbation and blessing;
upon which occasion it is said, that <i>the war was of God</i>, 1
Chron. v. 22. Nevertheless, when wars are proclaimed,
merely to satisfy the pride and avarice of princes, as in Benhadad’s
war against Ahab, 1 Kings xx. 1. <i>&amp; seq.</i> or the Romans,
who made war on the countries round about them,
merely to enlarge their own dominions, by ruining others; or,
like those which the Devil excites, and Antichrist carries on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>against the church, for their faithfulness to the truth, Rev. xii.
17. chap. xiii. 7. these wars are unlawful; and all the blood
shed therein, is a breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is no violation of this Commandment, to take away
the life of offenders, guilty of capital crimes, by the hand of
the civil magistrate; for this is elsewhere commanded, and
magistrates are appointed for that end, Deut. xvii. 8,-10.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It is no breach of this Commandment, when a person
kills another without design, or the least degree of premeditated
malice. Nevertheless, the utmost caution ought to be
used, that persons might not lose their lives through the carelessness
and inadvertency of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) In some instances, a person may kill another in his own
defence, without being guilty of the breach of this Commandment.
But this is to be considered with certain limitations; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] If there be only a design, or conspiracy against our
lives, but no immediate attempt made, to take them away; we
are to defend ourselves, by endeavouring to put him that designed
the execrable fact, out of a capacity of hurting us, by
having recourse to the protection of the law; whereby he may
be restrained from doing it, or we secured. This was the
method which Paul took, when the Jews had bound themselves
with an oath, to slay him; he informed the chief captain of
this conspiracy, and had recourse to the law for his safety,
Acts xxiii. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If there be a present attempt made against our lives,
we should rather chuse to disarm, or fly from the enemy, than
take away his life; but if this cannot be done, so that we must
either lose our own lives, or take away his, we do not incur
the least guilt, or break this Commandment, if we take away,
his life, to preserve our own, especially if we were not first in
the quarrel; nor give occasion to it by any injurious or unlawful
practices.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it may be enquired, whether it be lawful for two persons
to fight a duel, upon a set challenge, or provocation
given? In answer to which, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That, when a war, between two armies, may be issued,
and the shedding of much blood prevented hereby, it is not
unlawful, provided it be by mutual consent, and with the approbation
of those on both sides, who have a right of making
war and peace; and if the matter in controversy may be thus
decided, without tempting providence. We have a remarkable
instance of this, in the duel fought between David and Goliath,
in 1 Sam. xvii. Nevertheless,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, It is unlawful for two persons, each seeming too prodigal
of his life, to challenge, accept of, and, pursuant thereunto,
to endeavour to put an end to each others life, merely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>gratify their own passion, or pride. This, though falsely called
honour, will, in reality, render them vile in the eyes of God,
and notoriously guilty of the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may consider the wicked practice of those who
have obliged poor wretches, who were under their command,
to murder one another for their diversion. This Joab and
Abner did, when they said, <i>Let the young men arise and play
before us; and every one thrust his sword in his fellows side</i>,
2 Sam. ii. 14,-16. There is also an unlawful diversion,
which, though not altogether so barbarous and cruel, is, in
some respects, a breach of this Commandment, <i>viz.</i> when
persons fight with, and wound one another, without design of
killing, merely to get a little money, while entertaining a number
of unthinking persons with their folly; in which case they
that fight, and they that look on, are equally guilty, Prov.
xxvi. 18, 19. Thus concerning the sin of killing another; we
shall now account for two or three difficulties that occur in
scripture, relating to the actions of some good men, who seem
to have been guilty of the breach of this Commandment; but
were not really so.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, It is enquired, whether Elijah was chargeable with the
breach of it in destroying Baal’s prophets, which we read of
in 1 Kings xviii. 40. wherein it is said, that <i>he ordered that
none of them should escape; and he brought them down to the
brook Kishon, and slew them there</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In answer to which, it may be observed, that it was not a
small inoffensive error that these prophets of Baal were punished
for; but apostasy from God. And that the persons who
were thus punished, deserve it, will appear, if we consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That, they were the advisers and ring-leaders of all
Israel’s idolatry, and the abettors and principal occasion of
that violent persecution, which then raged against the Lord’s
prophets, and true worshippers.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Had they only been false prophets, and not persecutors,
they were according to the law of God to be put to death,
Deut. xiii. 6,-9.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This was done after a solemn appeal to God, and an
answer from heaven, by fire, which determined, not only who
was the true God, but who were his prophets, and consequently
whether Elijah deserved death, as an impostor, or Baal’s prophets.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Ahab himself was present, and all his ministers of state,
who had a right to execute justice on false prophets; and, it
is highly probable, that they consented to, and many of them
had an immediate hand in their death, which might be occasioned
by a sudden conviction in their consciences, proceeding
from the miracle which they had just before observed, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>from the universal cry of the people against them; so that the
thing was plainly of the Lord, to whom Elijah brought a
great deal of honour, and was far from being chargeable with
the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, It is farther enquired, whether Abraham’s offering
Isaac was a breach of this Commandment? This is proposed
as a difficulty by those who do not pay that deference to divine
revelation, as they ought, nor consider, that God cannot
command any thing which is contrary to his perfections; nor
do his people sin in obeying any command that is given by
him. However, that this matter may be set in a just light,
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That God, who is the sovereign Lord of life, may take
it away, when, and by whom he pleases. Therefore Isaac
had no more reason to complain of any wrong or injury done
him, by God, in ordering his father to sacrifice him, than any
one else has, who dies by his immediate hand, in the common
course of providence.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Abraham could not be said to do this with the temper
and disposition of a murderer, which such have, who are
guilty of the breach of this Commandment, who kill persons
in a passion, or out of envy or malice, being void of all natural
affection or brotherly love; but he acted plainly in obedience
to God’s command. His hand was lifted up against one
whom he loved equally to, or, it may be, more than his own
life, and, doubtless, he would rather have been, had God so
ordered it, the sacrifice, than the offerer.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This was done, as is more than probable, with Isaac’s
full consent. Hence some think, that his faith was no less
remarkable herein than that of Abraham. His willingness to
be offered, evidently appears, in that Abraham was in his
feeble and declining age, and Isaac in his full strength; for it
was not a little strength which was sufficient to carry wood
enough to answer this occasion, which we read he did, Gen.
xxii. 6. Besides, if Isaac had resisted, none was at hand to
assist Abraham against him, and, doubtless, he would have
strove in this matter as one who desired to be overcome.
Therefore we must suppose, that it is so far from being a
breach of this Commandment, that it was one of the most remarkable
instances of faith in scripture; and God’s design in
ordering him to do this, was, that it might be a type whereby
he would lead him into the glorious mystery of his not sparing
his own Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and of his willingness
to lay down his life a ransom for his people.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Some charge Moses with being guilty of the breach
of this Commandment, in killing the Egyptian, which we read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>of in Exod. ii. 11, 12. But, to vindicate him from this charge,
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That the Egyptian, whom he slew, not only <i>smote an
Hebrew</i>, as it is in this chapter, but he did it wrongfully, as
it is observed in Acts vii. 24. there was no offence given, nor
just reason for this injurious treatment, and to oppress or
abuse one that is in a miserable condition, as the Hebrews
were at that time, is an heinous crime in God’s account.
Moreover, to <i>smite</i>, in scripture, is often taken, for to <i>slay</i>;
so that it is not improbable, that the Egyptian slew the Hebrew;
or if he did not, it might be such an injury as deserved
death; which would have been inflicted in another manner,
had not Israel been denied, at that time, the protection of the
law.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Moses was, at this time, raised up, and called by God,
to be a ruler and a judge, to defend the cause of his oppressed
people; and in this action he first began to fulfil his commission;
though the people refused to own him, and seemed
to join with those that designed him evil for it; for which
reason their deliverance was put off forty years longer, while
he was an exile in the land of Midian, Acts vii. 24, 26. compared
with 30. Now to slay a public enemy and oppressor,
and, as it is probable, one who had forfeited his life, and that
with a commission from God, to act as a ruler and a judge
over his people, cannot be reckoned a breach of this Commandment.
Thus concerning the violation of this Commandment,
as including in it the murdering of our neighbour.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This Commandment is notoriously broken by those
who lay violent hands on themselves, which we have no instance
of any good man, in scripture, that was ever suffered to
do, but only such who were, like Saul, Ahitophel, Judas, and
others, of the most infamous character. This is a sin which
is attended with many aggravations; For,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is to act as though our lives were at our own disposal;
which are to be considered as a talent which we are entrusted
with by God, to improve for his glory; and he alone
has a right to dispose thereof at his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) This argues, and arises from, the highest discontent
and impatience under the hand of God, which is contrary to
that temper, which we ought to exercise as Christians, who
profess subjection to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It is contrary to nature, and that principle of self-preservation
which God has implanted in us; and, indeed, he
that does this, not only acts below the reason of a man, but
does that which even brutes themselves are not inclined to.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) It is a giving place to, and gratifying the Devil, who
acts agreeably to his character, as a murderer from the beginning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>when he tempts men to destroy both soul and body at
once.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) It is presumptuous and bold to resolve, that whatever
measure of duty God has prescribed for us to fill up in this
world, we will serve him no longer. If marshal law punishes
deserters with death, is there not a severe punishment due
unto those who do, as it were, desert the service of God by
self-murder? Nothing is more certain than this, that if duty
be enjoined by God, the time in which it is to be performed,
is also fixed by him, and not left to our determination.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) It is a rushing hastily into eternity, not considering the
consequence thereof, nor the awful tribunal of Christ, before
which they must immediately appear, and give an account of
this, as well as other sinful actions of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) It is done with such a frame of spirit, that a person
cannot, by faith, commit his soul into the hands of Jesus
Christ; for that requires a better temper of mind than any one
can be supposed to have, who murders himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it may be enquired, since, as was before observed, no
good man was ever guilty of this crime, whether Samson did
not break this Commandment in pulling down the house upon
his own head, as well as the Philistines?</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be answered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That Samson’s life, at this time, was a burden to himself,
useless to his brethren, a scorn to the open enemy, and
an occasion of their ascribing their deliverance to their idol;
and probably, it would have been soon taken away by them;
which circumstances, though they would not, in themselves,
have been sufficient to justify this action; yet they might justify
his desire, that God would put an end, to his life, and release
him out of this miserable world; especially if this would
redound more to his glory than any thing he could do for the
future, or had done in the former part of his life.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] It plainly appears, that God, in answer to his prayer,
not only gave him leave to take away his own life, together
with the lives of his enemies, but he wrought a miracle to enable
him to do it; and therefore it was a justifiable action, and
no breach of this Commandment, Judges xvi. 28,-30.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We shall now consider the heinous aggravation of this
sin, of taking away the life of another unjustly, and the terrible
judgments that such have ground to expect, who are guilty
hereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) According to the divine law, this sin is to be punished
with death, by the hand of the civil magistrate, Deut. xix. 11,
12. Thus Joab, who had deserved to die for murders formerly
committed, was slain, by David’s order, by his son
Solomon; though he sought protection by taking hold of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>horns of the altar, 1 Kings ii. 28, 29. Many other crimes
might be expiated by sacrifices, which God ordained should
be offered for that end; whereas, no satisfaction was to be accepted
for this sin but the blood of the murderer, Numb.
xxxv. 31. And it is a matter of dispute with some, whether
kings, who may pardon many crimes, by virtue of their prerogative,
can, according to the laws of God, pardon murder,
without being supposed to extend their clemency beyond its
due bounds?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) God often gives up those who are guilty of the sin of
murder, to the terrors of a guilty conscience, which is a kind
of hell upon earth; as in the instances of Cain, Lamech, and
others, Gen. iv, 13,-15. and 23, 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Such are followed with many remarkable instances of
divine vengeance; so that the blast of providence attends all
their undertakings. Thus David, after he had killed Uriah,
was followed with such rebukes of providence, that the latter
part of his life was rendered very uneasy thereby; and what
the prophet foretold was fulfilled, that <i>the sword should never
depart from his house</i>; that is, as long as he lived, 2 Sam. xii.
9, 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The judgments of God for his sin, are oftentimes transmitted
to posterity. Thus Simeon and Levi’s murder of the
Shechemites, was punished in the tribes that descended from
them; who, according to the patriarch’s prediction, were <i>divided
in Jacob, and scattered in Israel</i>, Gen. xlix. 7. And Saul’s
slaying the Gibeonites, was punished in David’s time, by a
famine occasioned thereby, 2 Sam. xxi. 1. And the murders
which the Jews had committed on the prophets in former
ages, were punished in the destruction of their state and nation;
when <i>all the righteous blood</i> that had been <i>shed upon the
earth, came upon them</i>, Matt. xxiii. 35.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Their lives are often shortened, and they brought to
the grave with blood. Thus Absalom perished by the just
judgment of God, for the murder of his brother, as well as
his other crimes; and in this the Psalmist’s observation holds
true, that <i>bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days</i>, Psal. lv. 23. We are now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. That this Commandment may be broken otherwise than
by the taking away the life of our neighbour. It may be
committed by a person in his heart, when he has not an opportunity
to execute his malicious designs; or is afraid to do
it, because of the punishment from men, which will ensue.
Thus the apostle says, <i>Whosoever hateth his brother, is a murderer</i>,
1 John iii. 15. Of this we have an instance in wicked
Ahab; who <i>hated</i> Micajah, because he <i>prophesied not good
concerning him, but evil</i>, 1 Kings xxii. 9. And, it is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>than probable, that this hatred would have broke forth into
murder, could he have laid hold on the least shadow or pretence
that might have put a colour on so vile an action. And
Jezebel was guilty of this sin, who threatened to murder the
prophet Elijah, chap. xix. 2. and the Jews, who were filled
with malice against our Saviour; for which reason they would
have put him to death at that time; but they feared the people,
Mark xi. 18. And as this is a sin that reigns in wicked
men, there are some instances hereof even in good men. Thus
David carried his resentment too far against Nabal, though a
churlish and ungrateful man, when he resolved, in his passion,
not only to take away his life, which was an unjustifiable action,
but to destroy the whole family, the innocent with the
guilty, 1 Sam. xxv. 21, 22. and he was sensible of his sin in
this passionate resolution, which occasioned his blessing God
for his preventing it, by Abigail’s prudent management.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another instance of sinful and unaccountable passion,
that cannot be excused from a degree of heart-murder in
Jonah; who was very angry because God was gracious, and
spared Nineveh, on their repentance; and in this fit of passion,
he desires that God would take away his life, justifies his
anger, and, as it were, dares him to cut him off; which was
as bad a frame as ever any good man was in. And all this
took its rise from pride, lest some should think him a false
prophet, who did not rightly distinguish between what God
might do, and would have done, had they not repented, and
what he determined to do, namely, to give them repentance,
and so to spare them. I say, rather than be counted a false
prophet, which, it may be, was a groundless surmise, he was
angry with God for sparing it, Jonah iv. 1-4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will be enquired, whether all anger is sinful, or a
breach of this Commandment? To which it may be answered,
That since the apostle says, <i>Be angry and sin not</i>, Eph. iv.
26. it implies, that there may be anger which is not sinful;
but, on the other hand, may rather be styled, a zeal for God.
Of this kind was that anger which our Saviour expressed
against the Scribes and Pharisees, when he calls them <i>serpents,
a generation of vipers</i>, Matt. xxiii. 33. and when he whipped
the buyers and sellers out of the temple; on which occasion it
is said, <i>The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up</i>, John ii. 15,
17. And the apostle reproved Elymas the <i>sorcerer</i>, who endeavoured
to <i>turn away the deputy from the faith</i>, with words
that seemed full of anger; when he addressed himself to him
in this manner; <i>O full of all subtilty, and all mischief thou
child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righteousness; Wilt thou
not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</i> Acts xiii.
10. And Peter could not reprove that vile hypocrite Simon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>Magus, when he offered to purchase the conferring the Holy
Ghost, without expressing some anger and resentment, as the
cause required, when he says, <i>Thy money perish with thee</i>,
&amp;c. chap. viii. 20, 21, yet that he might let him know that it
was only zeal to God that provoked his anger, he gives him
friendly advice to repent of this his wickedness, ver. 22.
From whence we may take occasion to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) What is the difference between sinful anger or passion,
and an holy zeal for God?</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] An holy zeal for God, leads us rightly to distinguish
between the person reproved, and his actions, that give us occasion
for it; so that we hate the sin, but not the person that
commits it. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>I hate the work of them
that turn aside</i>, Psal. ci. 3. But sinful anger is principally directed
against the person with whom we are offended.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] The honour of God is the only motive that excites holy
zeal; but pride or evil surmise, is generally the occasion of
sinful anger. Thus Jehu’s executing the vengeance of God,
in cutting off Ahab’s wicked family, was right, as to the matter
of it; yet it had a great mixture of ambition, pride, and private
hatred of them, as those whom he thought would stand
in competition with him for the crown; and for this action he
also desires the applause and esteem of the people; and therefore
says to Jonadab, <i>Come with me, and see my zeal for the
Lord</i>, 2 Kings x. 16. so that the one is attended with many
Other graces, the other with many sins.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Holy zeal for God inclines us to express anger against
his enemies, with sorrow and reluctancy, as being grieved for
their sin, and at the same time desiring their reformation and
salvation; but sinful anger meditates revenge, is restless till it
has accomplished it, Prov. iv. 16. and pleased with having
opportunities of executing it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Holy zeal sets aside, or is not much concerned about
injuries as directed against ourselves; but as they reflect dishonour
on the name of God, or are prejudicial to his interest
in the world. With this view it was that David says concerning
Edom, <i>Happy shall he be that dasheth thy little ones against
the stones</i>, Psal. cxxxvii. 9. when at the same time, he professes,
that it was for Jerusalem’s sake that he desired the
ruin of his enemies, and not his own; for he says, that he <i>preferred
Jerusalem above his chief joy</i>, ver. 6. Whereas, on the
other hand, sinful anger designs or wishes evil to others, to
promote our own interest and advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We shall now consider the aggravations of sinful passion.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] It unfits a soul for holy duties. Accordingly our Saviour
advises his people, first to <i>be reconciled to their brethren,
and then come and offer their gift</i>, Matt. v. 23, 24.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>[2.] If attempt to reprove sin, or persuade to duty, in passion,
it will tend to take away the force, and hinder the success
of the arguments we use.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] It will occasion sorrow and shame, when reflected on
in our most serious thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] It will expose us to Satan’s temptations, and occasion a
multitude of sins; therefore the apostle calls it, a <i>giving place
to the Devil</i>, Eph. iv. 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] The smallest injuries are hereby magnified, and our resentments
exceed their due bounds. We do not consider, as
we ought to do, that the injuries done against us, are very
small when compared with the sins we commit, whereby we
dishonour God.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] It is opposite to a Christian temper, and very much
unlike that frame of spirit, which our Saviour has recommended
concerning loving our enemies, Matt. v. 44. and is also
contrary to his example, <i>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not
again</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] As it is a stirring up our own corruptions, so it tends
to stir up the corruption of others, and provoke them to sin,
as one flame kindleth another, and hereby increaseth itself,
Prov. xxvii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We shall farther enquire, how we are to deal with
those whom we converse with, who are addicted to passion or
anger?</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We are to exercise a calm, meek, and humble disposition,
bearing reflections with patience, and replying to them
with gentleness; especially when it is more immediately our
own cause, and not the cause of God which is concerned
herein. <i>A soft answer turneth away wrath</i>, chap. xv. 1. <i>He
that is slow to wrath, is of great understanding</i>, chap. xiv. 29,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Let us take heed that we do nothing that tends to stir
up the passions of any. If a superior is disposed hereunto,
let us prudently withdraw from him; if it be an inferior, let
us reprove him with faithfulness; if it be in an equal, let us
take away the edge of it, by meekness, love, and tenderness
towards him, having compassion on his weakness; let us bear
injuries without revenging them, and <i>overcome evil with good</i>,
Rom. xi. 19,-12.</p>

    <div class='c000'><i>FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION</i>,</div>
    <div class='c000'>The Rev. Dr. Thomas Scott’s Remarks</div>
    <div class='c000'>ON</div>
    <div class='c000'>“<i>The Refutation of Calvinism</i>,</div>
    <div class='c000'>BY GEORGE TOMLINE, D.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>LORD BISHOP OF LINCOLN.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The writings of this eminent divine are held in the highest
estimation by the pious of various denominations. He is acknowledged
to be one of the best advocates for evangelical
truth, which the present age has produced. His commentary
on the scriptures has passed through three large editions in
this country and a fourth, larger than either of the former is
now preparing for press by W. W. W. in 3 vols. quarto, 7
dollars per volume, without any marginal references—the notes
following immediately after the text.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work now proposed for publication is a most able and
elaborate defence of those doctrines which are commonly called
evangelical, and which are by no means peculiar to the
Calvinists. The bishop of Lincoln, published what he was
pleased to call “a Refutation of Calvinism,” under which
“proscribed and odious name,” says the Christian Observer,
“he has attacked some of the fundamental points of that faith,
which was once delivered to the saints.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In this work of the Bishop,” continues the Christian Observer,
“he has greatly mistaken and misrepresented the sentiments
and the persons he undertook to refute, and in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>important points has maintained doctrines contrary to the declarations
of scripture.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Scott, in his remarks upon this publication of the Bishop
of Lincoln, most ably defends that system of religion,
which a great body of christians supposed to be contained in
the scriptures, from the uncandid and illiberal attacks of its
enemies, and obviates the unfounded objections which are so
often brought up against it. The reviewers in the <i>Christian
Observer</i>, after occupying about sixty pages of their miscellany
in commenting on the excellencies of Dr. Scott’s “remarks,”
conclude their review with the following passage. “We cannot,
however, conclude this long extended article, without recommending
the study of Dr. Scott’s laborious work to such

who did not consider how inconsistent some of those rhetorical ways of speaking,
he seems fond of, are with that doctrine, which, in other parts of his writings,
he maintained. Those words</i> Χριστοποιειν, <i>and</i> θεοποιειν, <i>which he sometimes uses to express
the nature, or consequence of this union between Christ and believers, are very
disgustful. In one place of his writings, (Vid. ejusd. Orat. 41.) exhorting Christians
to be like Christ, he says, That because he became like unto us</i>, γενωμεθα Θεοι δι αυτον,
efficiamur Dii propter ipsum; <i>and elsewhere, (in Orat. 35. de Folio.) he says</i>, Hic
homo Deus effectus postea quam cum Deo coaluit ἱνα γενωμαι τοσουτον θεος ὁσον εκ εινοc
ανθρωπος εγενηθη, ut ipse quoque tantum Deus efficiar quantum ipse homo. <i>And
some modern writers have been fond of the same mode of speaking, especially among
those who, from their mysterious and unintelligible mode of expressing themselves,
have rather exposed than defended the doctrines of the gospel. We find expressions
of the like nature in a book put forth by Luther, which is supposed to be written by
Taulerus, before the Reformation, called Theologia Germanica, and some others,
since that time, such as Parcelsus, Swenckfelt, Weigelius, and those enthusiasts,
that have adhered to their unintelligible and blasphemous modes of speaking.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That the invitations of the gospel are not restricted to a few amongst a
larger number who hear them, is clear, from various considerations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The term evangel, or gospel, importing good tidings, evinces, that it is designed
not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance and salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The blessings, which it announces, lead to the same conclusion; liberty is offered
to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
those who labour and are heavily laden, are invited to seek, and obtain rest: those
who hunger and thirst after righteousness, are assured that they shall be filled;
the riches of grace and of glory are promised to the poor in Spirit; sight is offered
to the blind; and howsoever diseased, those who are afflicted are invited to
come to the great Physician; and even those who are dead in sin are revived by
his life-giving word. Such are the circumstances of the worst of men, who are
consequently the objects of the mercies proffered in the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The unregenerate elect, who stand amongst those who will not be saved, are
like them, possessed of prevailing inclinations to sin, and equally impotent to
good: they are all equally guilty of an aversation of heart from God, and so possess
in themselves nothing which can evidence a right to gospel blessings more
than others.</p>

<p class='c006'>The invitations of the gospel are in universal terms, and although such terms
are sometimes restricted by the sense, yet where no such restriction appears,
they are to be taken in their own unlimited extent; the ransom is asserted to
have been rendered for all; the Lord willeth not the destruction of any, but that
all should turn and live; Christ proclaimed to sinners, <i>if any man thirst, let him
come unto me and drink</i>; and directed his disciples to go and <i>teach all nations</i>; and
it is his will, that the gospel should be preached <i>unto every creature</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If in the day of final account, the abominable crimes of Sodom and Gomorrha
shall evince less guilt than the impenitency of Chorazin and Bethsaida; the aggravation
of guilt, which the gospel produces, demonstrates that its messages
are directed unto the worst of men, as well as others.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who are guided by the light of nature, are guilty, because they violate
the rule of conscience: such as possessed the law of God were still more guilty,
but sinners under the light of the gospel, who trample under foot the blood of
Christ, and despise and reject the mercies of the gospel, are guilty in the highest
degree. It is just that they should not receive the offered pardon, but remain
under the condemnation of the law, the dominion of iniquity, the slavery of Satan,
and be left in their beloved darkness until they sink in despair. Yet nothing
but their own aversion rejects the invitation, or prevents their salvation: they
are straitened in their own bowels, and are the causes of their own destruction.
Thus salvation is offered in general, and God is just, though the application of
it is plainly special.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>The question between us and the Pelagians, is not whether the will sometimes
follows the dictates of the understanding, but, whether it either always does so? or,
if it be otherwise, whether that which hinders it does not arise from a defect in these
dictates of the understanding? Accordingly they speak of the dictates of the understanding
as practical, and not barely speculative, and with a particular application
to ourselves. They also consider the will as having been before in some suspense; but
that dictate of the understanding which it follows, is the last, after mature deliberation;
and it is supposed to have compared things together; and therefore presents a
thing, not only as good, but more eligible than any thing else, which they call a comparate
dictate of the understanding; and by this means the will is persuaded to a
compliance. But though this may be true in many instances that are natural; yet
daily experience proves, that it does not hold good with respect to things divine and
supernatural.</i></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The manners and maxims of the world accord with the inclinations of the
human mind, because they spring from them: the dispositions and the pursuits
of men are at variance with the laws of God, the doctrines of the gospel, and the
practice of the saints, this will appear by comparing them. That the human mind
should be brought to submit to the self-denial requisite to the character of a true
christian, its bias or bent must be changed. Because men are moral agents, various
motives are addressed to them to induce such change, when not attended
to, they aggravate their guilt: when they are followed by the change, which they
have a tendency to produce, those who yield are said to be “born of the word.”
Were it not for the information we derive from the scriptures we should probably
look no further than the proximate cause, and give man the glory; but these
teach us, that the Spirit of God is always in such change, if it be real, the efficient
cause: “God sanctifies <i>by</i> the truth,” he “<i>opens</i> the heart to attend” to the
word, and when any have <i>learned</i> from and been <i>taught</i> or <i>drawn</i> by the Father
they come unto Christ; they are therefore also in a higher sense <i>born of the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This work of God immediately upon the mind, is possible to him, who formed,
sustains, and knows the secrets of the heart; if we are unconscious of our creation,
support in existence, and the access of the Searcher of hearts to our minds,
we may be unconscious of his influence to change them. If this were sensible, it
might be a motive incompatible with the safety and moral government of beings,
who at best, whilst here, are imperfectly holy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The communication of the knowledge of saving truths immediately is unnecessary:
we have the sacred scriptures, which are competent to make us wise
unto salvation. The inspiration anciently given, is distinct from the change of
bias, or disposition necessary to a preparation for heaven, might exist without,
and is therefore inferior to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not the sole effect of moral suasion, it is a work of the spirit not the letter,
of power not the word: it is a birth, not by “blood, nor by the will of the
flesh, nor <i>by the will</i> of man, but of God,” and those only “who are of God, hear,”
believe, and obey his word.</p>

<p class='c006'>This influence is sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, riches to the poor,
health to the sick, and life to the dead. It is not incompatible with moral agency,
for the holy disposition is as free in its operation, as the former sinful inclinations
had been in theirs. The necessity of it to salvation, is no excuse for the impenitent;
grace is not necessary to the vindication of Divine justice: the preponderancy
of inclinations to evil is the essence of, not an apology for sin. It is very
strange if, because a man is so intent upon sinning that nothing can change him
but the almighty power of the Divine Spirit, he is on this very account innocent.—It
does not render the preaching of the word unnecessary, for besides that it is
commanded, and important to call men to repentance and faith, when the grace
has been given, God also usually accompanies his ordinances with his Spirit’s influences,
and seems in most cases, to direct in his providence the blessings of
his instructions to those whom he makes the subjects of his grace.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“I have seen it objected, that to suppose a change effected in the heart of
man, otherwise than by the power of moral means, is palpably absurd; as implying
an evident impossibility in the nature of things. It has been said, by a divine
of advanced age, and good sense; ‘The moral change of the mind in regeneration,
is of an essentially different kind from the mechanical change of the body,
when that is raised from the dead; and must be effected by the exertion of a different
kind of power. Each effect requires a power suited to its nature: and the
power proper for one can never produce the other. To argue from one to the
other of these effects, as the apostle has been misunderstood to do, in Eph. i. 20,
is therefore idle and impertinent.—The Spirit of God is possessed of these two
kinds of power, and exerts the one or the other, accordingly as he wills to produce
a change of the moral or physical kind, in moral beings or inanimate matter.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“But to this philosophical objection, however plausible and unanswerable it
may appear, I think the reply of our Saviour to the difficulty started by the Sadducees,
respecting the resurrection and a future state, is neither idle, nor impertinent:
‘Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of <i>God</i>.’ The
Almighty is not limited, as men are, to these two modes of operation, by moral
and mechanical means. The Spirit of God is possessed of a power of working in
a manner different from either of these; that is, supernaturally. The means by
which effects are brought to pass in a natural way, must indeed be different; according
to the nature of those effects, and of the subjects on which the operations
are performed: but when once we admit the idea of a work properly supernatural—an
effect produced not by the power of any means at all, we instantly
lose sight of all distinctions in the kind of power, or manner of working, adapted
to things of different natures. When God, by his omnipotent word alone, called
all nature into being at first, are we to suppose that he exerted different powers,
according to the natures of the things designed to be created; and that the power
proper to create inanimate matter, could never create a thinking mind! Are
we to conceive that angels and the souls of men were persuaded into being, by
arguments and motives; and that the material world was forced out of nothing,
by the power of attraction! So, in regard to quickening the dead, are we to imagine
that God can give new life to a soul dead in sin, only by moral suasion; and
that, if he will reanimate bodies which have slept thousands of years in the dust
of the earth, he has no other way to do it than by a physical operation! The
body of Christ was raised to life, I should suppose, not by any mechanical power,
but supernaturally. In this manner God always works, when he quickeneth the
dead, and calleth things that are not, as though they were. And what absurdity
can there be in supposing Him able to give a new principle of action, as well as
to give existence to any thing else, in this immediate manner?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some sound and sensible divines, it must be granted, in order to guard against
the notion of regeneration’s being effected by moral suasion, have called it a
physical work, and a physical change; but very needlessly, I apprehend, and
with very evident impropriety. The change is moral: the work producing it,
neither moral nor physical; but supernatural.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ὕπερβαλλον μεγεθος της δυναμεως αυτου—κατα την ενεργειαν του κρατους της ισχυος αυτου.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The change in regeneration has been often called the communication of
<i>a principle of spiritual life</i>. It is described as life, in the scriptures. Sensible objects
make no impressions on dead bodies, because insensible; and those, who
receive no impressions from divine truths, but remain unaffected by the charms
of holiness, are figuratively denominated <i>dead</i>. Life being the opposite of death,
such as are sensible of the Divine excellencies, and receive the impressions which
religious truths are calculated to make, may, in the same manner, be termed
<i>living</i>. Such also are called <i>spiritual</i>, because this holy activity is communicated
by the Spirit of God. “You hath he quickened;” and, because it has for its object
the things which have been revealed by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>These terms are derived from the Scriptures, but the word <i>principle</i> is destitute
of such support. It is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews: there it is used
for those fundamental doctrines, which are the <i>beginnings</i> of the doctrine of the
gospel; but this is not the meaning of the term in the above description. This
change is the immediate work of God, and not the communication of some operative
axiom of truth. There are natural principles of action; as habit, affection,
and passion: and there are moral; as sense of duty, fear of God, and love of holiness.
These are all termed principles, because they excite to action, and so are
the beginnings, or causes of it. But it is scarcely in this sense, that the term
principle is used in the description of regeneration; for it is said to be communicated,
and so must mean something distinct from, and the effect of the work
of the Spirit. Accordingly it has been called “a fixed impression of some spiritual
truth upon the heart.” But there is no truth, or other motive, sufficient to
prevail against the obduracy of the unrenewed heart; or to become a <i>principle</i>
of action to a soul dead in sin. Whatever that is in fallen man, which repels such
motives, and prevents their influence until some more worthy motive is thrown
into the scale, it is the work of the Spirit to remove it, and to give the soul an
activity towards holy things. No intervention of mediate causes seems necessary;
the Spirit of God is the agent; the soul of the man is the subject of influence;
and He is said to <i>open the heart, to give a new heart, to create anew, to enlighten
the mind in the knowledge of the truth, to work in us to will and to do</i>, or <i>to
give sight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf</i>. From such scriptural expressions
it may be gathered that sight, knowledge, new dispositions, and a change of inclinations,
are the <i>effects</i> of regeneration, and not the <i>thing itself</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This change is more important than all the gifts of providence, if man therefore
be the author of it, he is his own greatest benefactor, and must have the
highest glory. If the Holy Spirit acts no otherwise on the human soul, than by
addressing motives, angelic natures do also this; and no more power is ascribed
to the Searcher of hearts, than to them. Then also it will follow, that all professing
christians are of the same kind; and that it was improperly said, that they
“were not of us,” who afterwards have “departed from us.” Then also the advice
to those who are in the visible church “to examine,” and “prove themselves,”
whether Christ be “in them,” is without meaning, or utility; because
the thing to be inquired for is notorious, that is, their visible profession. And to
“be born again,” is but “to see the” visible “kingdom” of Christ: and so the
proposition spoken to Nicodemus was merely identical.</p>

appointed by God, for this purpose, says, That God hath made a combination
between hearing and believing; so that believing comes not without hearing, and

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When it is said “<i>no man can come unto me, except the Father who hath sent
me, draw him</i>,” the negation must be understood as expressive of <i>moral</i> impotency,
and as if it had been said “<i>ye will not come unto me that ye might have life</i>;”
but nevertheless as direct proof of the absolute necessity of divine grace to the
salvation of every person who is saved. That the aid is not merely necessary to
the <i>understanding</i> is evident from the guilt of unregeneracy, and from the supposition
of the Saviour whose reproof implies that it was the carnality of the <i>heart</i>
which created the impotency to come unto or believe on him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The propriety of exhortations to turn, repent, believe, and work out our own
salvation, is obvious; because such impotency is chiefly an aversion of heart. When
such motives are ineffectual, they prove the inveteracy of the opposition to God,
and argue the greater guilt. They are no evidence that grace is unnecessary, because
they have an important effect in the change of the man’s views, and pursuits,
when the Spirit of God has “<i>opened the heart</i>” to receive the necessary impressions;
and because these motives are rendered effectual by the Divine Spirit.
He grants us repentance, turns us, helps our unbelief, strengthens our faith,
and works in us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Because it is charged upon the evil that they “resist” the grace of God, and
therefore his Spirit will not always “strive” with men, it by no means follows,
that the success of grace depends merely upon our yielding; as often as men
yield to the strivings of the Spirit, a victory is obtained; for the carnal heart inclines
to evil until subdued by him: we are “made willing in a day of his power.”
Were it otherwise the glory of man’s salvation would belong to himself, at
least in part; but the language of the believer is “<i>not unto us, O Lord, not unto
us, but unto thy name, be the glory given</i>.” Nor is there any need to suppose man’s
salvation thus imputable to himself in order that the evil may be charged with
the blame of his destruction; for nothing excludes him but his own evil heart,
and this is his sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not result that the man, who is thus “made willing,” is in such manner
constrained as that his holiness, being the effect of compulsion, possesses no
moral beauty; because he acts as freely as the evil man does; and even more so,
for the latter is a slave to his preponderating evil inclinations. The believer
chooses holiness, and though he has nothing to boast of before God, his good
works may well justify him before men.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be yet objected, that this is a discouraging representation of the way of
obtaining happiness; it may be answered, that it can discourage only those, who
wish for happiness, at the same time that they more strongly incline to sensuality;
and such ought to be discouraged in their vain expectations: but it is highly
consolatory to such as prefer holiness and heaven; for it not only discovers to
them, that God has wrought in them to will and to do, but that he is engaged
for them, and will accomplish their salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Righteousness is taken ordinarily to signify a conformity to laws, or rules
of right conduct. Actions, and persons may respectively be denominated righteous.
The moral law, which is both distinguishable by the moral sense, and expressly
revealed, requires perfect and perpetual rectitude in disposition, purpose,
and action. Because none are absolutely conformed to this law, none can
fairly claim to be in themselves, simply, and absolutely righteous. Men are
said therefore to be righteous comparatively, or because the defects of many of
their actions are few, or not discernible by their fellow men. <i>To be made</i>, (or
constituted) <i>righteous</i>, or, to <i>be justified</i>, in the sight of God, in scriptural language
cannot mean, <i>to be made inherently righteous</i>. It is God who justifies, he
cannot call evil good, and cannot be ignorant of every man’s real demerit. This
righteousness of the saint has not consisted, under any dispensation, in his own
conformity to the Divine law; “<i>In the Lord have I righteousness</i>;” “<i>That I may
win Christ and be found in him, not having my own righteousness</i>.” If it did, there
would be no necessity for the aid of God’s Spirit to sanctify the nature of the
justified person. To be justified or constituted righteous, is therefore to be
<i>treated and accepted as righteous</i>. If God <i>justifies the ungodly</i>, his truth and justice
must be clear. He cannot be induced to depart from perfect rectitude, and
strict propriety. When the ungodly are justified, or treated as if righteous, it
is not on their own account, for their righteousness is defective; but <i>by the obedience
of one</i>, (that is Christ,) <i>many are made righteous</i>. The term <i>obedience</i>
excludes the essential righteousness of Christ as God. And his righteousness
which he rendered in our nature can neither be transfused into, nor transferred
unto his people, so as to be theirs inherently. Nor can an infinitely wise God
consider the righteousness of one man to be the personal righteousness of another.
But one person may receive advantages from the righteousness of another.
Sodom would have been spared if there could have been found ten holy
men in it. Millions may be treated kindly, because of favour or respect had for
one of their number espousing the cause of the whole. One man may become
the surety of, and perform conditions for many, or pay a ransom for them, and
purchase them from slavery. If it be said that one may not lay down his life,
especially if it be important, for the preservation of another’s; yet Christ
was the <i>Lord of life</i> and possessed what no mere creature can, the right to lay
down his life, and power to take it up again. The importance of the satisfaction
should be adequate to the honour of the law. But that every objection to such
substitution might be removed, it is shewn that, this was the very condition upon
which the restoration of the saints was suspended in the purposes of God before
man was created; and was <i>promised us in Christ Jesus before the world began</i>.
Justice therefore can neither object to the substitution, nor withhold the rewards.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I am not without painful apprehension, said Peter to John, that the views
of our friend James on some of the doctrines of the gospel, are unhappily diverted
from the truth. I suspect he does not believe in the proper <i>imputation</i> of sin
to Christ, or of Christ’s righteousness to us; nor in his being our <i>substitute</i>, or
representative.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> Those are serious things; but what are the grounds, brother Peter, on
which your suspicions rest?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> Partly what he has published, which I cannot reconcile with those doctrines;
and partly what he has said in my hearing, which I consider as an avowal
of what I have stated.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> What say you to this, brother James?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> I cannot tell whether what I have written or spoken accords with brother
Peter’s ideas on these subjects: indeed I suspect it does not: but I never
thought of calling either of the doctrines in question. Were I to relinquish the
one or the other, I should be at a loss for ground on which to rest my salvation.
What he says of my avowing my disbelief of them in his hearing must be a misunderstanding.
I did say, I suspected that <i>his views</i> of imputation and substitution
were unscriptural; but had no intention of disowning the doctrines themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> Brother James, I have no desire to assume any dominion over your
faith; but should be glad to know what are your ideas on these important subjects.
Do you hold that sin was properly imputed to Christ, or that Christ’s
righteousness is properly imputed to us, or not?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> You are quite at liberty, brother Peter, to ask me any questions on
these subjects; and if you will hear me patiently, I will answer you as explicitly
as I am able.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> Do so, brother James; and we shall hear you not only patiently, but, I
trust, with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> To impute,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> signifies in general, to <i>charge</i>, <i>reckon</i>, or <i>place to account</i>,
according to the different objects to which it is applied. This word, like many
others, has a <i>proper</i>, and an <i>improper</i> or figurative meaning.</p>

<p class='c006'>First: It is applied to the <i>charging</i>, <i>reckoning</i>, or <i>placing to the account</i> of persons
and things, <span class='fss'>THAT WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS TO THEM</span>. This I consider as its
<i>proper</i> meaning. In this sense the word is used in the following passages. “Eli
<i>thought</i> she, (Hannah,) had been drunken—Hanan and Mattaniah, the treasurers
were <i>counted</i> faithful—Let a man so <i>account</i> of us as the ministers of Christ, and
stewards of the mysteries of God—Let such an one <i>think</i> this, that such as we
are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also indeed when we
are present—I <i>reckon</i> that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Reckoning or accounting,
in the above instances, is no other than judging of persons and things
<i>according to what they are, or appear to be</i>. To impute sin in this sense is to charge
guilt upon the guilty in a judicial way, or with a view to punishment. Thus Shimei
besought David that his iniquity might <i>not be imputed to him</i>; thus the man
is pronounced blessed to whom the Lord <i>imputeth not iniquity</i>: and thus Paul
prayed that the sin of those who deserted him might <i>not be laid to their charge</i>.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In this sense the term is ordinarily used in common life. To impute treason
or any other crime to a man, is the same thing as charging him with having committed
it, and with a view to his being punished.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly: It is applied to the <i>charging</i>, <i>reckoning</i>, or <i>placing to the account</i> of
persons and things, <span class='fss'>THAT WHICH DOES NOT PROPERLY BELONG TO THEM, AS THOUGH
IT DID</span>. This I consider as its <i>improper</i> or figurative meaning. In this sense the
word is used in the following passages—“And this your heave-offering shall be
<i>reckoned</i> unto you <i>as though it were</i> the corn of the threshing-floor and as the fulness
of the wine-press—Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and <i>holdest</i> me for thine
enemy—If the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his
uncircumcision be <i>counted</i> for circumcision—If he hath wronged thee, or oweth
thee aught, <i>put that on mine account</i>.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is in this <i>latter</i> sense that I understand the term when applied to justification.
“Abraham believed God, and it was <i>counted</i> unto him for righteousness—To
him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is <i>counted</i> for righteousness.” The counting, or reckoning, in these instances,
is not a judging of things <i>as they are</i>; but <i>as they are not, as though they
were</i>. I do not think that faith here means the righteousness of the Messiah: for
it is expressly called “believing.” It means believing, however, not as a virtuous
exercise of the mind which God consented to accept instead of perfect obedience,
but <i>as having respect to the promised Messiah</i>, and so to his righteousness
as the ground of acceptance.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Justification is ascribed to faith, as healing frequently
is in the New Testament; not as that from which the <i>virtue</i> proceeds,
but as that which <i>receives</i> from the Saviour’s fulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if it were allowed that faith in these passages really means the object believed
in, still this was not Abraham’s <i>own</i> righteousness, and could not be properly
<i>counted</i> by him who judges of things as they are, as being so. It was <i>reckoned</i>
unto him <i>as if it were</i> his; and the effects, or benefits of it were actually
imparted to him: but this was all. Abraham did not become meritorious, or
cease to be unworthy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it to place our righteousness in the obedience of Christ, (says Calvin,)
but to affirm that hereby only we are <i>accounted</i> righteous; because the obedience
of Christ is imputed to us <span class='fss'>AS IF IT WERE OUR OWN</span>.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is thus also that I understand the imputation of sin to Christ. He was accounted
in the divine administration <i>as if he were, or had been</i> the sinner, that
those who believe in him might be accounted <i>as if they were, or had been</i> righteous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brethren, I have done. Whether my statement be just or not, I hope it will be
allowed to be explicit.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> That it certainly is; and we thank you. Have you any other questions,
brother Peter, to ask upon the subject?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> How do you understand the apostle in 2 Cor. v. 21. <i>He hath made him
to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him?</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> Till lately I cannot say that I have thought closely upon it. I have understood
that several of our best writers consider the word αμαρτια (<i>sin</i>) as frequently
meaning a <i>sin-offering</i>. Dr. Owen so interprets it in his answer to Biddle,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
though it seems he afterwards changed his mind. Considering the opposition
between the sin which Christ was made, and the righteousness which we
are made, together with the same word being used for that which he was <i>made</i>, and
that which he <i>knew not</i>, I am inclined to be of the doctor’s last opinion; namely,
that the sin which Christ was made, means <i>sin itself</i>; and the righteousness
which we are made, means <i>righteousness itself</i>. I doubt not but that the allusion
is to the sin-offering under the law; but not to its being <i>made a sacrifice</i>. Let me
be a little more particular. There were two things belonging to the sin-offering.
<i>First</i>: The imputation of the sins of the people, signified by the priest’s laying
his hands upon the head of the animal, and confessing over it their transgressions;
and which is called “putting them upon it.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> That is, it was <i>counted</i> in
the divine administration <i>as if the animal had been</i> the sinner, and the only sinner
of the nation. <i>Secondly</i>: Offering it in sacrifice, or “killing it before the Lord
for an atonement.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Now the phrase, <i>made sin</i>, in 2 Cor. v. 21. appears to refer
to the <i>first</i> step in this process in order to the last. It is expressive of what was
preparatory to Christ’s suffering death rather than of the thing itself, just as
our being <i>made righteousness</i> expresses what was preparatory to God’s bestowing
upon us eternal life. But the term <i>made</i> is not to be taken literally; for that
would convey the idea of Christ’s being really the subject of moral evil. It is expressive
of a divine <i>constitution</i>, by which our Redeemer with his own consent,
stood in the sinner’s place, as though he had been himself the transgressor; just
as the sin-offering under the law was, in mercy to Israel, reckoned or accounted
to have the sins of the people “put upon its head,” with this difference; that
was only a shadow, but this went really to take away sin.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> Do you consider Christ as having been <i>punished, really and properly</i>
<span class='fss'>PUNISHED</span>?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> I should think I do not. But what do you mean by punishment?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> An innocent person may <i>suffer</i>, but, properly speaking, he cannot be
<i>punished</i>. Punishment necessarily supposes <i>criminality</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> Just so; and therefore as I do not believe that Jesus was in any sense
criminal, I cannot say he was really and properly punished.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> Punishment is the infliction of natural evil for the commission of moral
evil. It is not necessary, however, that the latter should have been committed
by the party—Criminality is supposed: but it may be either personal or imputed.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> This I cannot admit. Real and proper punishment, if I understand the
terms, is not only the infliction of natural evil for the commission of moral evil;
but the infliction of the one <i>upon the person who committed the other, and in displeasure
against him</i>. It not only supposes criminality, but that the party punished
was literally the criminal. Criminality committed by one party, and imputed
to another, is not a ground for real and proper punishment. If Paul had sustained
the punishment due to Onesimus for having wronged his master, yet it would
not have been real and proper punishment <i>to him</i>, but <i>suffering</i> only, as not being
inflicted in displeasure against him. I am aware of what has been said on this
subject, that there was a more intimate <i>union</i> between Christ and those for whom
he died, than could ever exist between creatures. But be it so, it is enough for
me that the union was not such as <span class='fss'>THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE ONE BECAME THOSE OF
THE OTHER</span>. Christ, even in the act of offering himself a sacrifice, when, to speak
in the language of the Jewish law, the sins of the people were put or laid upon
him, gave himself nevertheless <span class='fss'>THE JUST FOR THE UNJUST</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> And thus it is that you understand the words of Isaiah, <i>The Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> Yes, he bore the punishment due to our sins, or that which, considering
the dignity of his person, was equivalent to it. The phrase “He shall bear
his iniquity,” which so frequently occurs in the Old Testament, means, he shall
bear the punishment due to his iniquity.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> And yet you deny that Christ’s sufferings were properly <i>penal</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> You would not deny eternal life which is promised to believers to be
properly <i>a reward</i>; but you would deny its being <i>a real and proper reward</i> <span class='fss'>TO
THEM</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> And what then?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> If eternal life, though it be a reward, and we partake of it, yet is really
and properly the reward of Christ’s obedience, and not our’s; then the sufferings
of Christ, though they were a punishment, and he sustained it, yet were really
and properly the punishment of our sins, and not his. What he bore <i>was</i> punishment:
that is, it was the expression of divine displeasure against transgressors.
So what we enjoy is reward: that is, it is the expression of God’s well-pleasedness
in the obedience and death of his Son. But neither is the one a punishment
<i>to him</i>, nor the other, properly speaking, a reward <i>to us</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>There appears to me great accuracy in the scriptural language on this subject.
What our Saviour underwent is almost always expressed by the term <i>suffering</i>.
Once it is called a <i>chastisement</i>: yet there he is not said to have been
chastised; but “the chastisement of our peace was <i>upon him</i>.” This is the same
as saying he bore <i>our</i> punishment. He was made a curse for us: that is, having
been reckoned, or accounted the sinner, as though he had actually been so, he
was treated accordingly, as one that had deserved to be an outcast from heaven
and earth. I believe the wrath of God that was due to us was poured upon him,
but I do not believe that God for one moment was angry or displeased <i>with him</i>,
or that he smote him from any such displeasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a passage in Calvin’s <i>Institutes</i>, which so fully expresses my mind,
that I hope you will excuse me if I read it. You will find it in Bk. ii. chap. xvi.
§ 10, 11. “It behoved him that he should, as it were, hand to hand, wrestle with
the armies of hell, and the horror of eternal death. The chastisement of our
peace was <i>laid upon him</i>. He was smitten of his Father for our crimes, and
bruised for our iniquities: whereby is meant that he was put in the stead of the
wicked, as surety and pledge, yea, and as the very guilty person himself, to
sustain and bear away all the punishments that should have been laid upon
them, save only that he could not be holden of death. Yet do we not mean that
God was at any time either his enemy, or angry with him. For how could he
be angry with his beloved Son, upon whom his mind rested? Or how could
Christ by his intercession appease his Father’s wrath towards others, if, full of
hatred, he had been incensed against himself? But this is our meaning—that
he sustained the weight of the divine displeasure; inasmuch as he, being
stricken and tormented by the hand of God, <span class='fss'>DID FEEL ALL THE TOKENS OF GOD
WHEN HE IS ANGRY AND PUNISHETH</span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> The words of scripture are very express—He hath <i>made him to be sin
for us</i>—He was <i>made a curse for us</i>.—You may, by diluting and qualifying interpretations,
soften what you consider as intolerable <i>harshness</i>. In other words,
you may choose to correct the language and sentiments of inspiration, and teach
the apostle to speak of his Lord with more decorum, lest his personal purity
should be impeached, and lest the odium of the cross, annexed by divine law,
remain attached to his death: but if you abide by the obvious meaning of the
passages, you must hold with <i>a commutation of persons</i>, the <i>imputation</i> of sin and
of righteousness, and a <i>vicarious punishment</i>, equally pregnant with <i>execration</i>
as with <i>death</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> I wish brother Peter would forbear the use of language which tends not
to convince, but to irritate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> If there be any thing convincing in it, I confess I do not perceive it. I
admit with Mr. <i>Charnock</i>, “That Christ was ‘made sin’ <i>as if he had</i> sinned all
the sins of men; and we are ‘made righteousness,’ <i>as if we had</i> not sinned at
all.” What more is necessary to abide by the obvious meaning of the words? To
go further must be to maintain that Christ’s being <i>made sin</i> means that he was
literally rendered wicked, and that his being <i>made a curse</i> is the same thing as
his being punished for it according to his deserts. Brother Peter, I am sure, does
not believe this shocking position: but he seems to think there is a medium between
his being treated <i>as if he were</i> a sinner, and his <i>being one</i>. If such a medium
there be, I should be glad to discover it: at present it appears to me to have
no existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brother Peter will not suspect me, I hope, of wishing to depreciate his judgment,
when I say, that he appears to me to be attached to certain terms without
having sufficiently weighed their import. In most cases I should think it a privilege
to learn of him: but in some things I cannot agree with him. In order to
maintain the <i>real</i> and <i>proper punishment</i> of Christ, he talks of his being “guilty
by imputation.” The term <i>guilty</i>, I am aware, is often used by theological writers
for <i>an obligation to punishment</i>, and so applies to that voluntary obligation
which Christ came under to sustain the punishment of our sins: but strictly speaking,
guilt is the <i>desert</i> of punishment; and this can never apply but to the offender.
It is the opposite of innocence. A voluntary obligation to endure the punishment
of another is not guilt, any more than a consequent exemption from obligation
in the offender, is innocence. Both guilt and innocence are transferable
in their effects, but in themselves they are untransferable. To say that Christ
was <i>reckoned</i> or <i>counted</i> in the divine administration <i>as if he were</i> the sinner, and
came under an obligation to endure the curse or punishment due to our sins, is
one thing: but to say he <i>deserved</i> that curse, is another. Guilt, strictly speaking,
is the inseparable attendant of transgression, and could never therefore for
one moment occupy the conscience of Christ. If Christ by imputation became
<i>deserving</i> of punishment, we by non-imputation cease to deserve it; and if our
demerits be literally transferred to him, his merits must of course be the same
to us: and then, instead of approaching God as <i>guilty</i> and <i>unworthy</i>, we might
take consequence to ourselves before him, as not only guiltless, but meritorious
beings.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> Some who profess to hold that believers are justified by the righteousness
of Christ, deny, nevertheless, that his <i>obedience itself</i> is imputed to them:
for they maintain that the scripture represents believers as receiving only the
<i>benefits</i>, or effects of Christ’s righteousness in justification, or their being pardoned
and accepted for Christ’s <i>righteousness sake</i>.—But it is not merely <i>for the
sake</i> of Christ, or of what he has done, that believers are accepted of God, and
treated as completely righteous; but it is <span class='fss'>IN</span> him as their Head, Representative,
and Substitute; and by the imputation of that <i>very obedience</i> which as such he
performed to the divine law, that they are justified.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> I have no doubt but that the imputation of Christ’s righteousness presupposes
a <i>union</i> with him; since there is no perceivable fitness in bestowing benefits
on one <i>for another’s sake</i> where there is no union or relation subsisting between
them. It is not such a union, however, as that <span class='fss'>THE ACTIONS OF EITHER BECOME
THOSE OF THE OTHER</span>. That “the scriptures represent believers as <i>receiving</i>
only the benefits or the effects of Christ’s righteousness in justification,” is a remark
of which I am not able to perceive the fallacy: nor does it follow that his
obedience itself is not imputed to them. Obedience itself may be and is imputed,
while its effects only are <i>imparted</i>, and consequently <i>received</i>. I never met with
a person who held the absurd notion of imputed benefits, or imputed punishments;
and am inclined to think there never was such a person. Be that however
as it may, sin on the one hand and righteousness on the other, are the proper
objects of imputation; but that imputation <i>consists</i> in charging or reckoning
them to the account of the party in such a way as to <i>impart</i> to him their evil
or beneficial effects.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> The doctrine for which I contend as taught by the apostle Paul, is neither
novel, nor more strongly expressed than it has formerly been by authors of
eminence.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> It may be so. We have been told of an old protestant writer who says,
that “In Christ, and by him, every true Christian may be called <i>a fulfiller of the
law</i>:” but I see not why he might not as well have added, Every true Christian
may be said to have been slain, and, if not to have redeemed himself by his own
blood, yet to be worthy of all that blessing, and honour, and glory, that shall be
conferred upon him in the world to come.—What do you think of Dr. <span class='sc'>Crisp’s</span>
Sermons? Has he not carried your principles to an extreme?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> I cordially agree with <span class='sc'>Witsius</span>, as to the impropriety of calling Christ
<i>a sinner, truly a sinner, the greatest of sinners</i>, &amp;c. yet I am far from disapproving
of what Dr. <span class='sc'>Crisp</span>, and some others, <i>meant</i> by those exceptionable expressions.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> If a Christian may be called <i>a fulfiller of the law</i>, on account of Christ’s
obedience being imputed to him, I see not why Christ may not be called <i>a transgressor
of the law</i>, on account of our disobedience being imputed to him. Persons
and things <i>should be called what they are</i>. As to the <i>meaning</i> of Dr. <span class='sc'>Crisp</span>,
I am very willing to think he had no ill design: but my concern is with the meaning
which his words convey to his readers. He considers God in charging our
sins on Christ, and accounting his righteousness to us, as reckoning of things <i>as
they are</i>. (p. 280.) He contends that Christ was <i>really</i> the sinner, or guilt could
not have been laid upon him. (p. 272.) Imputation of sin and righteousness, with
him, is literally and actually <span class='fss'>A TRANSFER OF CHARACTER</span>; and it is the object of
his reasoning to persuade his believing hearers that from henceforward Christ is
the sinner, and not they. “Hast thou been an idolater, says he; a blasphemer, a
despiser of God’s word, a profaner of his name and ordinances, a thief, a liar,
a drunkard—If thou hast part in Christ, <i>all these transgressions of thine become
actually the transgressions of Christ, and so cease to be thine; and thou ceasest to
be a transgressor from the time they were laid upon Christ, to the last hour of thy
life</i>: so that now thou art <i>not</i> an idolater, a persecutor, a thief, a liar, &amp;c.—thou
art not a sinful person. Reckon whatever sin you commit, when as you
have part in Christ, you are all that Christ was, and Christ is all that you
were.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If the <i>meaning</i> of this passage be true and good, I see nothing exceptionable in
the expressions. All that can be said is, that the writer explicitly states his principle
and avows its legitimate consequences. I believe the principle to be false.—(1.)
Because neither sin nor righteousness are <i>in themselves</i> transferable. The
act and deed of one person may <i>affect</i> another in many ways, but cannot possibly
become his act and deed.—(2.) Because the scriptures uniformly declare Christ
to be sinless, and believers to be sinful creatures.—(3.) Because believers themselves
have in all ages <i>confessed</i> their sins, and applied to the mercy-seat for <i>forgiveness</i>.
They never plead such an union as shall render their sins not theirs,
but Christ’s; but merely such a one as affords ground to apply for pardon <i>in his
name</i>, or <i>for his sake</i>; not as worthy claimants, but as unworthy supplicants.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever reasonings we may give into, there are certain times in which <i>conscience</i>
will bear witness, that notwithstanding the imputation of our sins to
Christ, <i>we are actually the sinners</i>; and I should have thought no good man
could have gravely gone about to overturn its testimony. Yet this is what Dr.
Crisp has done. “Believers <i>think</i>, says he, that they find their transgressions in
their own consciences, and they <i>imagine</i> that there is a sting of this poison still
behind, wounding them: but, beloved, if this principle be received for a truth,
that God hath laid thy iniquities on Christ, how can thy transgressions, belonging
to Christ, be found in thy heart and conscience?—Is thy conscience
Christ?” p. 269.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps no man has gone further than Dr. <span class='sc'>Crisp</span> in his attempts at consistency;
and admitting his principle, that imputation consists in a transfer of character,
I do not see who can dispute his conclusions. To have been perfectly consistent,
however, he should have proved that all the confessions and lamentations
of believers, recorded in scripture, arose from their being under the <i>mistake</i>
which he labours to rectify; that is, <i>thinking</i> sin did not cease to be theirs, even
when under the fullest persuasion that the Lord would not impute it to them,
but would graciously cover it by the righteousness of his Son.—— ——</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> I think, brother Peter, you expressed at the beginning of our conversation,
a strong suspicion that brother James denied the <i>substitution of Christ</i>, as
well as the proper imputation of sin and righteousness. What has passed on the
latter subject would probably tend either to confirm or remove your suspicions
respecting the former.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> I confess I was mistaken in some of my suspicions. I consider our friend
as a good man; but am far from being satisfied with what I still understand to
be his views on this important subject.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>John.</i> It gives me great pleasure to hear the honest concessions of brethren,
when they feel themselves in any measure to have gone too far.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> I shall be glad to hear brother James’s statement on <i>substitution</i>, and
to know whether he considers our Lord in his undertaking as having sustained
the character of a <i>Head</i>, or <i>Representative</i>; and if so, whether the persons for
whom he was a substitute were the elect only, or mankind in general.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> I must acknowledge that on this subject I feel considerably at a loss,
I have no consciousness of having ever called the doctrine of substitution in
question. On the contrary, my hope of salvation rests upon it; and the sum of
my delight, as a minister of the gospel, consists in it. If I know any thing of my
own heart, I can say of my Saviour as laying down his life <i>for, or instead of</i> sinners,
as was said of Jerusalem by the captives—<i>If I forget</i> <span class='fss'>THEE</span>, <i>let my right hand
forget: If I do not remember</i> <span class='fss'>THEE</span>, <i>let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth</i>!</p>

<p class='c006'>I have always considered the denial of this doctrine as being of the essence of
Socinianism. I could not have imagined that any person whose hope of acceptance
with God rests not on any goodness in himself but entirely on the righteousness
of Christ, imputed to him <i>as if it were his own</i>, would have been accounted
to disown his substitution. But perhaps, my dear brother, (for such I
feel him to be, notwithstanding our differences,) may include in his ideas of this
subject, that Christ was so our <i>head</i> and <i>representative</i>, as that what he did and
suffered, we did and suffered in him.—If no more were meant by this, resumed
James, than that what he did and suffered is graciously accepted on our behalf
<i>as if it were ours</i>, I freely, as I have said before, acquiesce in it. But I do not believe,
and can hardly persuade myself that brother Peter believes, the obedience
and sufferings of Christ to be so ours, as that we can properly be said to have
obeyed and suffered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Christ was and is our <i>head</i>, and we are his members: the union between him
and us, however, is not in all respects the same as that which is between the
head and the members of the natural body: for that would go to explain away
all distinct consciousness and accountableness on our part.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the term <i>representative</i>, if no more be meant by it than that Christ so
personated us as to die in our stead, that we, believing in him, should not die, I
have nothing to object to it. But I do not believe that Christ was so our representative,
as that what he did and suffered, we did and suffered; and so became
meritorious, or deserving of the divine favour.—But I feel myself in a wide field,
and must entreat your indulgence while I take up so much of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter and John.</i> Go on, and state your sentiments without apology.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> I apprehend then that many important mistakes have arisen from considering
the interposition of Christ under the notion of <i>paying a debt</i>. The blood
of Christ is indeed the <i>price</i> of our redemption, or that for the sake of which we
are delivered from the curse of the law: but this metaphorical language, as well
as that of <i>head and members</i>, may be carried too far, and may lead us into many
errors. In cases of debt and credit among men, where a surety undertakes to
<i>represent</i> the debtor, from the moment his undertaking is accepted, the debtor
is free, and may claim his liberty, not as a matter of favour, at least on the part
of the creditor, but of strict justice. Or should the undertaking be unknown to
him for a time, yet as soon as he knows it, he may demand his discharge, and,
it may be, think himself hardly treated by being kept in bondage so long after
his debt had been actually paid. But who in their sober senses will imagine this
to be analagous to the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ? Sin is a debt only
in a metaphorical sense: properly speaking, it is a <i>crime</i>, and satisfaction for it
requires to be made, not on pecuniary, but on moral principles. If Philemon had
accepted of that part of Paul’s offer which respected property, and had placed
so much to his account as he considered Onesimus to have “owed” him, he
could not have been said to have <i>remitted</i> his debt; nor would Onesimus have
had to thank him for remitting it. But it is supposed of Onesimus that he might
not only be in debt to his master, but have “wronged” him. Perhaps he had
embezzled his goods, corrupted his children, or injured his character. Now for
Philemon to accept of that part of the offer, were very different from the other.
In the one case he would have accepted of a pecuniary representative; in the
other of a moral one; that is, of a mediator. The satisfaction in the one case
would annihilate the idea of remission; but not in the other. Whatever satisfaction
Paul might give to Philemon respecting the wound inflicted upon his character
and honour as the head of a family, it would not supersede the necessity
of pardon being sought by the offender, and freely bestowed by the offended.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reason of this difference is easily perceived. Debts are transferable; but
crimes are not. A third person may cancel the one; but he can only obliterate
the <i>effects</i> of the other; the <i>desert</i> of the criminal remains. The <i>debtor</i> is accountable
to his creditor as a <i>private</i> individual, who has power to accept of a
surety, or if he please, to remit the whole, without any satisfaction. In the one
case he would be just; in the other merciful: but no place is afforded by either
of them for the <i>combination</i> of justice and mercy in the same proceeding. The
<i>criminal</i>, on the other hand, is amenable to the magistrate, or to the head of a
family, as a <i>public</i> person, and who, especially if the offence be capital, cannot
remit the punishment without invading law and justice, nor in the ordinary discharge
of his office, admit of a third person to stand in his place. In extraordinary
cases, however, extraordinary expedients are resorted to. A satisfaction
may be made to law and justice, as to the <i>spirit</i> of them, while the <i>letter</i> is dispensed
with. The well-known story of Zaleucus, the Grecian law-giver, who
consented to lose one of his eyes to spare one of his son’s eyes, who by transgressing
the law had subjected himself to the loss of both, is an example. Here,
as far as it went, <i>justice and mercy were combined</i> in the same act: and had the
satisfaction been much fuller than it was, so full that the authority of the law,
instead of being weakened, should have been abundantly magnified and honoured,
still it had been <i>perfectly consistent with free forgiveness</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally: In the case of the debtor, satisfaction being once accepted, justice
<i>requires</i> his complete discharge: but in that of the criminal, where satisfaction
is made to the wounded honour of the law, and the authority of the lawgiver,
justice, though it <i>admits</i> of his discharge, yet no otherwise <i>requires</i> it than as it
may have been matter of promise to the substitute.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not mean to say that cases of this sort afford a competent representation
of redemption by Christ. That is a work which not only ranks with extraordinary
interpositions, but which has no parallel: it is a work of God, which leaves
all the petty concerns of mortals infinitely behind it. All that comparisons can
do, is to give us some idea of the <i>principle</i> on which it proceeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the following passage in our admired <i>Milton</i> were considered as the language
of the law of innocence, it would be inaccurate—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“——Man disobeying,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c015'>He with his whole posterity must die:</div>
      <div class='line'>Die he, or justice must; unless for him</div>
      <div class='line'>Some other able, and as willing, pay</div>
      <div class='line'>The rigid satisfaction, death for death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Abstractedly considered, this is true; but it is not expressive of what was the
revealed law of innocence. The law made no such condition, or provision; nor
was it indifferent to the law-giver who should suffer, the sinner, or another on
his behalf. The language of the law to the transgressor was not <i>thou shalt die,
or some one on thy behalf</i>; but simply <i>thou shalt die</i>: and had it literally taken its
course, every child of man must have perished. The sufferings of Christ in our
stead, therefore, are not a punishment inflicted in the ordinary course of distributive
justice; but an extraordinary interposition of infinite wisdom and love:
not contrary to, but rather above the law, deviating from the letter, but more
than preserving the spirit of it. Such, brethren, as well as I am able to explain
them, are my views of the substitution of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Peter.</i> The objection of our so stating the substitution of Christ, as to leave
no room for the free pardon of sin, has been often made by those who avowedly
reject his satisfaction; but for any who really consider his death as an atonement
for sin, and as essential to the ground of a sinner’s hope, to employ the objection
against us, is very extraordinary, and must, I presume, proceed from inadvertency.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>James.</i> If it be so, I do not perceive it. The grounds of the objection have
been stated as clearly and as fully as I am able to state them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That faith is a holy duty is evident, because it never obtains, except where
the bent, or bias of the mind has been changed by the Holy Spirit; yet it is like
all the other works of man, imperfect, and might be stronger. That it is necessary
in every action is clear, for whatsoever is not of faith is sin; both because
it is the work of an enemy, and because it cannot be accepted, having no reference
to Christ. Faith is always accompanied by other holy traits of character,
as repentance, love, patience, humility, and the like. The reason of which is evident;
for faith is an act of the renewed man, and all the other graces must accompany.
But it is even less holy than love; “now abideth faith, hope, charity,
(love)—the greatest of these is charity.” It is incapable of procuring by its
righteousness our justification, because imperfect. If it were the holiness of the
duty of faith, which justifies the man before God, we should read of a justification
by love, patience, humility, or holiness in general. No such declaration occurs
in the scriptures, but the reverse; “for by the deeds of the law shall no flesh
be justified,” which is manifestly spoken not merely of the corporal energy, but
of the action taken with the intention.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the righteousness of the duty of faith justifies, there could be no propriety
in saying that we are “justified by Christ,” or his righteousness; there would
have been no need of a Saviour, and all the sacrifices of former days were useless.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we are to depend upon the righteousness of our believing for our justification,
the believing in Christ will be of no importance, because Christ is then not
our Saviour; in proportion as our hopes are founded upon our own holiness, they
are withdrawn from Christ.—This will also destroy the righteousness of faith,
for if it be useless there can be no holiness in believing.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the holiness consist not in the act of believing, but in the disposition of the
believer, and if it is for this, that he is justified; salvation is then a debt, not
grace; we have whereof to boast; we are justified by the deeds of the law; the
offence of the cross has ceased; and Arians, Socinians, Unitarians, and Deists are
seeking justification also in the same way.</p>

<p class='c006'>That repentance, and holiness are necessary to <i>salvation</i> is true, because every
man who is justified is also sanctified; and that faith, considered as a holy duty,
is necessary in the same manner, is equally true; but faith is also useful in our
<i>justification</i>, and in a manner, in which, it does not appear, that repentance and
holiness can be.</p>

<p class='c006'>To say that they are conditions of salvation is to speak ambiguously; that we
cannot be saved without them, is as certain as that we cannot be justified, without
being also sanctified; but to say, that by performing them a title to happiness
is vested in us, is to rob Christ of his glory, and to put the crown on man’s
head. Besides, the condition of holiness is not accomplished till death, and as the
condition of our justification is not performed till then, we are never justified in
life, which is plainly contrary to the scriptures.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Abraham believed God and it was imputed or counted to him for righteousness.”
This passage of Scripture is found with little variation also in the
Epistle to the Galatians (iii. 6.) and in the Epistle of James (ii. 23.) and in each
of the places it seems to have been introduced in support of its context from the
first book of Moses. (xv. 6.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses is giving at that place a visionary (as we suppose) correspondence between
Jehovah and Abraham; in which the Lord promises to the patriarch to
be his “shield and exceeding great reward,” and upon Abraham’s complaining
that he was childless, his attention is directed to the stars, and he is told that
it will be equally impracticable to number his posterity, and then follow the
words “Abraham believed <i>in</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it is given as an old-testament proof of that which has been a little before
asserted “that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law,”
but because this doctrine would seem to make void the law, the apostle states
this objection, then denies it with abhorrence, and introduces for his support
Abraham’s justification before God, “if Abraham were justified by works he
hath whereof to glory, but not before God; for what saith the scriptures? Abraham
believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the letter to the christians of Galatia he aims to bring them back from depending
on their obedience to the moral and ceremonial laws, to a reliance upon
Christ for salvation, he declares that “by the works of the law no flesh shall be
justified” in the sight of God; and that christians are “dead to the law,” “seek
to be justified by Christ,” and “live by the faith of the Son of God.” He asserts
“if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain.” He charges
the Galatians with folly. After having heard, seen, and experienced the doctrines
of the Gospel, its extraordinary and ordinary spiritual powers, to go back
to dead works would argue something like fascination. And then to show that
the Gospel mode of justification by faith was not peculiar to the Gospel he quotes
from the book of Genesis these words; “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted
to him for righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The apostle James reprehends such as profess to be believers and yet are not
careful to maintain good works; such professions of faith are less credible than
the fruits of holiness; “show <i>me</i> thy faith without thy works, and I will show
<i>thee</i> my faith by my works.” Faith without works he pronounces to be dead,
not merely inoperative, but destitute of a living principle. He then introduces
Abraham’s example of offering up Isaac as a proof of his faith; this work being a
manifest effect of his faith in God, justifies, in the sight of all men, his character
as a believer, “and the scripture” he says “was <i>fulfilled</i> which saith Abraham
believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.” The offering
up of Isaac, having taken place several years after it had been said that “Abraham
believed God,” was an undeniable evidence of the truth, and a fulfilment,
of that scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>Abraham’s faith here mentioned has been understood as implying both the act
of believing God’s promises and his yielding to the call of God by emigrating,
&amp;c.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> which faith, and its fruits, though an imperfect righteousness, was, it is
alleged, by the favour of God accepted as a justifying righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the apostle here contrasts faith with works, and denies a justification before
God to be attainable by our obedience, consequently his introduction of Abraham’s
justification by his good deeds would have destroyed his own argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> understand Abraham to have been justified on the account of the
mere act of believing: and this has been confined to his faith in the one promise
of a numerous posterity.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the Lord<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> “in judging Abraham will place on one side of the account
his duties, and on the other his <i>performances</i>, and on the side of his performances
he will place <i>his faith</i>, and by mere favour value it equal to a complete
performance of his duty, and reward him as if he were a perfectly righteous
person.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Faith is the mind’s assent to external evidence; faith thus strictly considered
as an act, is man’s act, as much so as any can be, and as the understanding at
least in its application to the evidence must be accompanied by the consent of
the will, here is every thing that is necessary to constitute a work, and accordingly
it is commanded as a duty, the neglect of which is criminal. If it be thus
that faith justifies the believer in the sight of God, then there is no propriety in
saying we are not justified by works, and if it were possible still less in adducing
the example of Abraham’s justification by that which was no more than a
duty to prove that we cannot be justified by works, “Christ being the end of
the law for righteousness to every one who believeth.” If man can be so justified
boasting is not excluded he has whereof to glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the design of the apostle was to show that Abraham himself one of the
holiest of men with all his good deeds, and implicit obedience to divine commands
was not justified for his own holiness or godliness, for that is the opinion
he is combating, but by what he calls faith. When the things which we are
required to believe are of a spiritual nature, the “carnal mind” requires to be
freed from its prejudices before it will “receive them,” and because supernatural
aid is necessary to such minds and all naturally possess them, such “faith”
must unquestionably be “the gift of God” in a sense higher than that of every
other species of faith exercised under the support of Divine Providence. If faith
is a gift of God it merits nothing for us, can never create an obligation on Divine
justice for remuneration, and so can never be a <i>justifying</i> righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>In his epistle to the Galatians that which he terms a being “justified by faith”
he also denominates a being “justified by faith in Christ” so that his justifying
faith is not merely a belief of the truth of what God has spoken, but is connected
in some manner with Christ, and that it is not the mere act of believing in Christ
which is the ground of such justification is plain from this, that he expresses the
same thing by the words, “being justified by Christ.” If it is true that we are
justified by faith, and also justified by Christ, it must be meant in different senses,
and to give effect to these words thus differently connected, it seems necessary
to suppose the righteousness of Christ as the meritorious cause or ground of justification,
and faith the instrumental. “To as many as received him to them gave
he power to become the sons of God, even to as many as believed on his name,”
or at least as the concomitant of it, where all other requisites exist as well as
grace for its production.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not the <i>holiness of his faith</i> that is accounted for righteousness to him:
faith is a holy duty but not more so than some others, and not so much so as love,
“now abide faith, hope, love, and the greatest of these is love;” nor are christians
ever said to be justified by love, joy, peace, patience, or by any other grace,
except by faith. From whence it follows that it is not the holiness of faith for
which the believer is justified, and yet that there is some property not common
to any other grace or duty, which must be concerned in our justification; and
no doubt it is because faith lays hold on him for whose sake alone we can be justified.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or faith may be put for its object, as the words fear, hope, joy, and love are;
God is our fear, our hope, &amp;c. “Thy faith hath saved thee,” it was not her faith,
but its object, Christ’s power, that healed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seed which was promised embraced Christ, whose day Abraham saw afar
off; so this faith had the Redeemer for its object. In the epistle to the Galatians
there follow the quotation these words, “as many as are of faith are the children
of Abraham,” these are called his spiritual seed, and believe in Christ, now if
all who believe in Christ are thereby the children of Abraham, and Abraham their
father or pattern of faith, his faith must have been of the same kind. There
could have been little propriety in giving a faith of any other kind as a pattern to
those who are to believe in Christ that they may be “justified by his blood.”</p>

we may add occular demonstration. Now these things are not properly the object of
faith, or the assent we give to the truth hereof, is not founded barely upon evidence,
in which respect faith is distinguished from it; for which reason we call it an assent
to a truth, founded on evidence.</i></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r61'>61</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Truth in the abstract is not the object of faith, but that which is true.
The word of God when represented as the object of faith is not to be understood
of words and letters, nor even of axioms and propositions, nor is the Divine veracity,
though certainly confided in, the object of faith, or that which is assented
unto. The promises which the old testament-believers had, and reposed in,
were not the objects of faith, but the things which they saw afar off, and which
were the ground of their rejoicing. When we are required to believe <i>on</i> Jesus
Christ, it is not his human, not his Divine nature, not his person, nor even his
mediatorial character which is the object of our faith; for any of these alone
could be no ground of confidence of salvation, or hope, much less produce joy
in the believer. Every thing essential to our salvation must be considered, as
the object of our faith; the mercy of God, the love of Christ, the purpose and
the act of offering, and accepting the sacrifice to Justice of our sins, and the warrant
to us to fix our hope and trust in this atonement; the firm conviction of the
truth of these things may be denominated faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet this conviction, or free assent of the understanding is not the faith, which
accompanies salvation; if we can suppose it possible, that there should not be a
corresponding impression made upon the will and affections. <i>With the heart
man believeth unto salvation.</i> In this expression the heart is not put for the intellectual,
but moral powers, and must not be understood as if the will assumed
the office, peculiar to the understanding, of judging of evidence; but only that
the assent of the understanding must be of such a kind, and to such a degree, as
to produce a decisive co-operation of all the powers of the man, both of soul
and body, to be saved in the way, and by the means discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such an effort for salvation supposes the bent, or bias of the mind to be inclined
towards God, and his glory. And certain it is, that the work, or act of
believing, depends so much upon the moral state of the man, that although he
may assent to every article of faith, and desire an interest in the advantages of
religion, he never believes with the heart in the sense above mentioned, until this
charge has been wrought in him. On this account faith may well be denominated
the work or gift of God, for he only, according to the scriptures can effect
this change.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet it is not because there is any defect in the evidence of these important
truths; nor because of any natural, that is physical, defect of the intellectual
powers of man, that he does not believe the Divine revelation; but because his
affections are pre-occupied, and his inclinations directed into another channel,
whereby he is unwilling to apply himself unto these truths, and is prejudiced
against the holiness, which is required, and the self denial that is necessary to
attain the blessings of salvation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r62'>62</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Faith, according to the beloved disciple John, and the great St. Paul, is the
<i>belief of the truth</i>; the <i>believing that Jesus is the Christ</i>; or a giving <i>credit to the
record that God gave of his Son</i>. These definitions are all of the same import,
and are all divine. Being dictated by the Spirit of God, they cannot be contradicted
by any, although some have glossed upon them, till they have brought in
a sense diverse from the inspired writers. This faith, when it is <i>real</i>, as distinguished
from that uninfluential assent to the gospel, which crowds, who hear
it, profess to have, is an effect of the <i>divine influence in us</i>; hence it is said to be <i>of
the operation of God</i>; and that it is <i>with the heart</i> man believeth unto righteousness.
As the righteousness by which the sinner is justified, is the sole work of
Christ <i>for him</i>, so this is the work of the Holy Ghost <i>in him</i>, and no less necessary
in its proper place; it being that, without which a sinner cannot apprehend,
receive, and rest upon Christ for eternal life. By faith, as before observed, he
becomes acquainted with the glories of the character of Jesus, the fulness of
grace in him, and the suitableness and perfection of his righteousness; in consequence
of this faith, he admires the Saviour’s personal excellencies, flies to
him, ventures all upon him, and rejoices in him. These, to speak plainly, are
all so many effects of faith. The sinner must have a view of the Saviour’s excellency,
<i>before</i> he will admire it. He must be persuaded, that Christ is the
only safe refuge, <i>before</i> he will <i>fly</i> to him. He must know that there is in Christ
sufficient matter of consolation, <i>before</i> he will <i>rejoice</i> in him. Of all these he is
entirely satisfied <i>by faith</i> in the testimony of God: subsequent to which is his
<i>coming</i>, or <i>flying</i> to him, <i>trusting</i> in, or <i>venturing</i> all upon him, <i>rejoicing</i> in
him, &amp;c. e. g. Joseph’s brethren heard that there was corn enough in Egypt;
they believed the report: this was faith; upon this they went down for a supply.
Doubtless this was an <i>effect</i> of their faith; for had they not believed the
tidings, they would never have gone. So a sinner must <i>believe</i> that Christ is a
full and complete Saviour, <i>before</i> he will <i>run</i> or <i>fly</i> to him. Sense of misery, and
faith in his sufficiency, are the main stimulus. Or, I am sick, I hear of an able
physician, I believe him to be so, upon which I apply to him: my <i>application</i>
to him, and my <i>belief</i> of his character, are as distinct as any two things can be:
my <i>trusting</i> my life in his hands, is an effect of my <i>believing</i> him to be an able
physician. This distinction is obvious in the sacred writings, as well as in the
nature of things. <i>He that</i> cometh <i>to God, must</i> believe <i>that he is</i>. Here is a manifest
distinction between <i>coming</i> and <i>believing</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>I apprehend that the same distinction should be observed, between <i>believing</i>
in Christ, and <i>receiving</i> him. If so, it will follow, that “to receive Christ in
all his offices, as a prophet, a priest, and a king,” is not properly <i>faith</i>, but an
<i>effect</i> of it, and inseparably connected with it. It is certain that a man must
believe that Jesus is the Christ, and that he sustains these offices, before he can
or will receive him in this light. Christ <i>came unto his own</i> (meaning the Jews)
<i>but his own received him not</i>. This refusing to <i>receive</i> him was not unbelief, but
an effect of it. Hence should you be asked, why they did not receive him? The
answer is ready, <i>because</i> they did not believe him to be the Christ. Nothing is
more plain than that unbelief was the grand <i>cause</i> why they rejected him. On
the other hand, nothing is more evident, than that <i>receiving</i> Christ, is an effect
of <i>believing</i> in him. And should you ask the man who defines faith, “a receiving
Christ in all his offices,” why he thus receives him? he himself will be obliged
to observe this distinction; for the only just answer he can give you is, “<i>because
I believe</i> he sustains them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we see that faith is entirely distinct from the righteousness which justifies;
at the same time it is indispensably necessary, answering great and good
purposes. Under its influence the sinner <i>flies</i> to Jesus, the hope set before him,
and trusts his immortal interest in his hands, being perfectly satisfied with his
adorable character. Faith is also the medium of peace and consolation. You
may with equal propriety attempt to separate light and heat from the sun, as
peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, <i>from the faith of God’s elect</i>.
The degree of Christian consolation may be greater or less, according to the
strength and influence of faith. At one time the believer may have an inward
peace and tranquility, which is exceedingly agreeable. At another time he may
be favoured with what St. Paul calls <i>joy unspeakable and full of glory</i>. At another,
guilt may rob him of his comfort, and separate between him and his God.
Such are his exercises in the present state of things. But he is far from making
a righteousness of his <i>frames</i>, <i>feelings</i>, or <i>experiences</i>. The distinction between
these he well understands. The <i>righteousness</i> by which he expects to be justified,
is the work of Christ alone; the <i>faith</i> by which he is enabled to receive it,
is <i>of the operation of God</i>; the consolations that he enjoys are from this glorious
Christ, in believing, or through faith: all as different as A, B, and C. His dependence
for acceptance with God is neither on his faith nor experiences, but
on Christ <i>alone</i>. At the same time he cannot conceive it possible, for a poor,
wretched, undone sinner to be enabled to believe in Christ for eternal life, and
not <i>rejoice</i>. A view of the glories of his person, and the fulness and freeness of
his grace, cannot fail of introducing <i>strong consolation</i>.</p>

things, which were great blemishes in them; and, in other parts of this elaborate
work, proves that those who lived in the first ages of the church, and were attached
to their philosophy, were by this means, as he supposes, led aside from many great
and important truths of the gospel; of this number Origen, Justin Martyr, and
several others. And he further supposes, that what many of them advanced concerning
the liberty of man’s will, as to what respects spiritual things, gave occasion
to the Pelagians to propagate those doctrines that were subversive of the grace
of God; and that the Arian and Samosatenan heresies took their rise from hence.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r76'>76</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The natural knowledge of God and his goodness, gives some encouragement
to guilty creatures to repent of their sins, and to return to God by a general
hope of acceptance, though they had no promise of pardoning grace. And
this was the very principle upon which some of the better sort of the Gentiles
set themselves to practise virtue, to worship God, and endeavour to become like
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not say, that natural religion can give sinful men a full and satisfying assurance
of pardon upon their repentance; for the deepest degrees of penitence
cannot oblige a prince to forgive the criminal: but still the overflowing goodness
of God, his patience and long-suffering, notwithstanding their sins, may
evidently and justly excite in their hearts some hope of forgiving  grace: and I
think the words of my text cannot intend less than this, that God has not left
them without witness, when he gave them rain from heaven, when he satisfied
their appetites with food, and filled their hearts with gladness. What was it
that these benefits of their Creator bore witness to? Was it not that there was
goodness and mercy to be found with him, if they would return to their duty,
and abandon their own ways of idolatry and vice. Surely, it can never be supposed,
that the apostle here means no more than to say, that the daily instances
of divine bounty in the common comforts of life, assured them, that God had
some goodness in him, and blessings to bestow on their bodies; but gave them
no hope of his acceptance of their souls, if they should return and repent never
so sincerely. The Ninevites themselves, when threatened with destruction,
repented in sackcloth and ashes; for, said they, Who can tell but God will turn
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? Nor were
they mistaken in their hope, for God saw their works, that they turned from
their evil way, and he repented of the evil that he had threatened, Jonah iii. 5-10.
And there is yet a more express text to this purpose, Rom. ii. 4. Despisest
thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing
that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? And if God leads us
to repentance, by a sense of his goodness, surely he gives hope that our repentance
shall not be in vain: and though, perhaps, I could not affirm it with boldness,
and certainty by the mere light of reason, yet I may venture to declare,
upon the encouragement of these scriptures, that if there should be found any
sinner in the heathen world, who should be thus far wrought upon by a sense of
the goodness of God, as to be led sincerely to repent of sin, and seek after mercy,
God would find a way to make a discovery of so much of the gospel, as was
necessary for him to know, rather than such a penitent sinner should be left under
condemnation, or that a guilty creature should go on to eternal death in
the way of repentance. Cornelius the Centurion, who feared God, who prayed
to him daily, and wrought righteousness, according to the light of his conscience,
had both an angel and an apostle sent to him, that he might receive
more complete instruction in the matters of his salvation. Acts x. 1-6. and from
30-35.“ Dr. Watts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f222'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r222'>222</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been, perhaps correctly, asserted that repentance is neither a duty
discoverable by the law of nature, nor the written law of God; because it is unfit,
that a law, appointing death for the violation of its precept, should also discover
to the culprit a way of escape from its own penalty incurred.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there existed purposes of mercy before the law was made; these have
been revealed by a gracious Sovereign; the condition of men, as prisoners of
hope possessing competent evidence of the compassion of the Lawgiver, points
to repentance. Sacrifices in former ages discover not only a consciousness of
guilt, but a glimmering hope at least, of pardon. It is possible that these were
the offspring of tradition among the Gentiles, rather than the deductions of the
light of nature. But in either way, sorrow for sin is a duty founded on the will
of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is therefore a duty, perfectly reasonable, and expressly revealed on the sacred
page. The strength to perform it is from the King of Providence and Grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is necessary in its production a discovery of guilt, liability to misery,
and entire helplessness. The general belief, or profession of these truths, does
not prove in event to be a cause adequate to produce a total change in a man’s
views, pursuits, desires, aversions, labours, joys, and sorrows. There is necessary
some deep sense, or strong conviction of guilt. This, with respect to its
proximate cause, may originate in various ways; by reflecting on the Divine
Sovereignty and Majesty; by a solemn contemplation of the excellency and loveliness
of the moral perfection of Deity; by an affecting sight of his goodness and
mercy to the individual in particular; by attending to the awful subject of Divine
Justice, seen in the sufferings of Christ, or anticipated in the future judgment,
and final sufferings of the damned. Such convictions are produced in
great mercy to the individual, how dearly soever they cost him, whether the
prostrated idols, on which the sensual affections were fastened, were companions,
friends, relations, honour or wealth. Disease, approaching death, or any
thing which shall dissolve the unhallowed attachment to earth, may by the Divine
blessing produce this change, the glory of which will always really belong
to Divine grace, which works unseen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bitterness of such sorrows is sometimes extreme, when he who wounded alone
can cure. The effects of it are subsequently salutary, both to deter from
sin and to strengthen the party’s faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>The degrees of penitential sorrow are extremely various in different converts.
He who has been convinced of gospel truths step by step, and has been in the
same manner brought to the love and fear of God, and to a universal conscientiousness,
may have grounds of peace and comfort equally safe, as he whose convictions
have been the most sensible; for not their height but their fruits prove
them to be genuine.</p>

scriptures, in which it does not denote an absolute impossibility of the thing, but only
that if it comes to pass it will be with much difficulty. Thus it is said</i>, Acts xx. 16.
<i>that the Apostle</i> Paul hasted, if it were possible for him to be at <i>Jerusalem</i> the day
of Pentecost; <i>where his making haste argues that the thing was not in itself impossible,
but difficult. And</i> Rom. xii. 18. <i>we are exhorted</i>, if it be possible, as much
as in us lieth, to live peaceably with all men; <i>which shews that it is hard indeed
so to do; nevertheless, we are to use our utmost endeavours to do it, which does not
argue that the thing is in itself altogether impossible. And there is another scripture
they bring to justify this sense of the words in</i> Matt. xix. 23-26. <i>in which our Saviour’s
design is to shew the difficulty of a rich man’s entering into the kingdom of
heaven, which he compares to a</i> camel’s going through the eye of a needle; <i>by which
very few suppose, that the beast, so called, is intended, but a cable-rope, which is
sometimes called a</i> camel; <i>thus the Syriack<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a> and Arabick versions translate the word</i>:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>And a learned writer observes, that the Jews, in a proverbial way, express the difficulty
of a thing by that of a cable-rope’s passing through the eye of a needle, See
Buxt. Lex. Talmud. Pane 1719. and Bochart Hiero. Part. 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 3. And
by</i> needle <i>is not meant that which is used in working, but an iron, through which a
small rope may be easily drawn; though it was very difficult to force a camel or cable-rope
through it; therefore they suppose our Saviour is not speaking of a thing
which is absolutely impossible, but exceeding difficult; and this may be inferred from
his reply to what the disciples objected</i>, who then can be saved, <i>when he says</i>, with
men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. <i>And to apply this
to the scripture under our present consideration, they suppose that the apostle, when
he speaks of the renewing of those persons to repentance, does not intend that which
is absolutely impossible, but that it cannot be brought about but by the extraordinary
power of God, with whom all things are possible.</i></p>

as objects of God’s hatred, as in Heb.</i> vi. 8. <i>and consequently is inconsistent with
the character of believers; yet, in other places it may be taken according to the

altogether destitute of faith</i>, <i>though they are not able to vindicate themselves in all
respects as blameless. That the apostle uses the word in this sense here, seems probable
from the application he makes of it to himself; it is said, ver. 3.</i> Ye seek a proof
of Christ speaking in me, δοκιμην ζητειτε; <i>and verse 6. he says</i>, I trust that ye shall

apostle uses the word</i> αδοκιμοι, <i>as signifying disapproved; and therefore as it is
applied to those he speaks of in verse 5. the meaning is this; you seek to know whether
we are approved of God as ministers; therefore I would advise you to examine yourselves,
whether you be in the faith, and to prove your ownselves: and if you know
not yourselves, you are in this respect blame-worthy, or to be disapproved; especially
because you seem to have been negligent as to the duty of self-examination. Whether
he who is diligent in the exercise of this duty, and yet cannot apprehend that he is

<div class='footnote' id='f124'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r124'>124</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The belief of a separate state is very ancient. Cicero and Seneca have asserted,
that all nations believed the immortality of the soul. Yet we know there
were not only individuals, but sects who were exceptions. Saul the first king
of Israel believed that the soul survived the death of the body, or he would neither
have made laws against necromancers, nor have applied to one in his distresses.
If Samuel was raised, it is a fact, directly in point, but the words though
express, are probably an accommodation to the sentiments of men. The son of
Sirach who lived two hundred years before Christ, says that Samuel prophesied
after he was dead. (Ecclus. c. 46. v. 20.) And Josephus in his account of the
life of Saul, shows his belief to be that Samuel actually arose. The same feats
of apparitions which the disciples had, still exist with the common people, and are
proofs that they entertain the same sentiment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some of the Pharisees, who are represented as believing a separate state,
thought souls might return to other bodies. This was the opinion of Josephus
with respect to the virtuous; and also of those Jews, who supposed that Jesus
was Elijah or Jeremiah; but the question of the disciples, whether a man had
been born blind for his own sins, implies a possibility of a return also of the wicked
into other bodies. Nevertheless the prevailing opinion of the Pharisees was
of a separate state; otherwise Paul’s professing their sentiments, which must
have been known to him, was disingenuous; nor, if they had known the difference,
would they have protected him. The approbation of the multitude when he
proved the doctrine from the words of Jehovah to Moses at the bush, (Matt. xxii.
32.) and the parable of Lazarus and the rich man, evince that the common opinion
was such.</p>

<p class='c006'>This subject, has been enlightened, not first brought to light, through the Gospel,
but plainly asserted: <i>this day shalt thou be with me in paradise. At home in the body,
and absent from the Lord, absent from the body, and present with the Lord</i>, is descriptive
but of two states. The desire <i>to depart to be with Christ</i>, shows an immediate
expectation. And otherwise it cannot be said that the spirits of just men
are <i>made perfect</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Jews, Greeks, and Romans assigned the Heaven to the gods, earth to men,
and under the earth (שאול, αδης, inferi) to the dead. The passages “the spirit
shall return to God,” and “the spirit of a man goeth upwards” are not exceptions,
for then they would prove that the evil, as well as the good, went to heaven.
That the spirit is disposed of by God, and that the spirit of a man survives
the death of the body, seem to be all that is respectively implied. Samuel was
believed to come out of, and return to his place under the earth; and Saul was
to be with him, below the earth; but, possibly, in a different apartment. Thus
Abraham and Lazarus were in sight of, and only divided from the man in torments
by a gulph.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the gospel the place of separate saints is represented to be in Heaven.
Heaven had been always assigned to God among the Jews, and even the heathens
thought it the most honourable place: Virgil assigned it to Cæsar. Jesus declared
he came from thence, and would return thither; and for the comfort of his disciples,
told them, he would prepare a place for them, and take them to himself.
They saw him actually ascend. He is to come from thence, and to bring them
with him to judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>This change of representation implies no contradiction, for pure spirits are not
confined to place. Our souls are connected with our bodies, and therefore go and
come with, or rather in them. But when the connexion is broken, the soul cannot
be said to be in one place more than another, except as it is occupied with
material objects. It can attend to one thing only at once, and therefore when in,
it cannot be out of the body, and must be wherever occupied, but not in any
<i>place</i>, except concerned with material objects. The infinite Spirit had no connexion
with space in all the eternity which preceded creation; since time began
as every thing is known and supported by him, he is said to be in all places. But
the idea of place is not necessary to our conceptions of Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>To speak of the planets as the residence of spirits, and to talk of souls flying
through the <i>visible</i> Heavens in quest of paradise is idle. If all souls must ascend
to Heaven, from India they go in a direction opposite to our course thither.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no sun nor moon enjoyed by saints in glory; the Lord is their light.
And spiritual bodies are not flesh and blood, nor belly, nor meats; nor corruptible
nor mortal; but fit for the society of spirits. The soul at death is discharged
from the prison of these bodies, and not confined to place. It receives new
faculties, which entertain it with more than substitutes for the sensations it had
in the body; it obtains a perception of light more vivid than in dreams, and permanent.
It enjoys the discernment, society, and communion of other Spirits;
the presence of God and the Redeemer; and progresses in the knowledge and love
of God, and so in holiness and happiness forever.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r143'>143</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The doctrines of the immortality of the soul, and of the resurrection of
the body equally rest upon the will and word of God. But when viewed with the
eye of natural reason, they have been deemed to possess very unequal grounds
of probability. The properties of matter and of mind are so very different, they
have been distinguished by almost all. If the mind be not matter, no argument
for its extermination can be drawn from the dissolution of the body; and as its
materiality has never been shown, no premises have been found from which its
death can be inferred. Some wise men who had not the scriptures, have indeed
withholden their belief; but the reason is discernible, they have demanded proofs
which the God of nature has not vouchsafed; and their rejection of the preponderating
evidence of probability, argues weakness and fastidiousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The resurrection of the body has been held to be impossible. If so, the impossibility
should either consist in the absolute incapacity in the dead body to be
raised; but this it does not, for death can only reduce the body to its first element,
and the dust which has been a body is not any more unfit to be reanimated,
than it was to receive life in the first instance; or it must be owing to some
detect of wisdom or power, or of both in him, who should raise the body; but
God is unchangeable, and in all respects as able to raise him from the dead, as to
create man at the first; and there is no contradiction implied in the thing, which
should prevent the exertion of his power; a resurrection is therefore possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The usual arguments for its probability drawn from analogy to the return of
day, of spring, of vegetation, &amp;c. are not conclusive. But those drawn from the resurrection
of Christ, from the identity of man considered as a compound from
the removal of moral evil, from which natural evils arise, from the earnest expectation
of animal nature for a better condition, and from the perfection of the
future state, seem to raise a presumption which is probable; yet these are not
appreciated by the natural man; hence the world has so generally denied a resurrection
of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The testimony of the Holy Spirit on both points has been always the same, but
not with equal lustre.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jesus Christ explicitly affirmed both, and brought his proofs from the old
testament, pressed them as motives of comfort or terror to saints and sinners,
and so connected their truth with that of his own character, that every thing
which proves the latter, is a proof of the former. Not only did his actually
raising the dead, and arising himself, prove that the dead shall rise, but every
prophecy accomplished in him, and every miracle wrought by him and his apostles,
the continuance of his church, the purity of his system of doctrines, the doctrines
of election, redemption, justification, regeneration and perseverance, as
well as the express declarations on this subject, both in the old and new testament,
all form a solid mass of evidence upon which the hopes of the Christian
may firmly rest.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r153'>153</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“By affirming, that the grain produced from the seed sown, is not the
very body which is sown, the apostle I think insinuates, that the body to be
raised is not numerically the same with the body deposited at death, but something
of the same kind formed by the energy of God. Having such an example
of the divine power before our eyes, we cannot think the reproduction of the body
impossible, though its parts be utterly dissipated. Farther, although the very
numerical body is not raised, yet the body is truly raised, because what is raised,
being united to the soul, there will arise in the man thus completed, a consciousness
of his identity, by which he will be sensible of the justice of the retribution
which is made to him for his deeds. Besides, this new body, will more than supply
the place of the old, by serving every purpose necessary to the perfection and
happiness of the man in his new state. According to this view of the subject,
the objection taken from the scattering of the particles of the body that dies, has
no place; because it does not seem necessary, that the body to be raised, should
be composed of them. For the scripture no where affirms, that the same numerical
body is to be raised. What it teaches is; that the dead shall be raised.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f195'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r195'>195</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>God is an <i>infinite</i> being. This also is a principle established by both natural
and revealed religion. The soul of man is finite, and, to whatever perfection
it may be advanced, it will always continue to be so. This is another indisputable
principle. It would imply a contradiction to affirm, that an infinite
Spirit can be seen, or <i>fully</i> known, in a strict literal sense, as it is, by a finite
spirit. The human soul, therefore, being a finite spirit, can never perfectly see,
that is, fully comprehend, <i>as he is</i>, God, who is an infinite spirit. The proposition
in our text, then, necessarily requires some restriction. This inference
arises immediate from the two principles now laid down, and this second consequence
furnishes another ground of our reflections.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, although it would be absurd to suppose, that God, an infinite spirit, can
be fully known by a finite human spirit, yet there is no absurdity in affirming,
God can <i>communicate</i> himself to a man in a very close and intimate manner proper
to transform him. This may be done four ways. There are, we conceive,
four sorts of communications; a communication of ideas; a communication of
love; a communication of virtue, and a communication of felicity. In these four
ways, <i>we shall see God</i>, and by thus seeing him <i>as he is, we shall be like him</i> in
these four respects. We will endeavour by discussing each of these articles
to explain them clearly; and here all your attention will be necessary, for without
this our whole discourse will be nothing to you but a sound, destitute of
reason and sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first communication will be a communication of <i>ideas</i>. We shall <i>see God
as he is</i>, because we shall participate his ideas; and by seeing God as he is, we
shall become <i>like him</i>, because the knowledge of his ideas will rectify ours, and
will render them like his. To know the ideas of an imperfect being is not to
participate his imperfections. An accurate mind may know the ideas of an inaccurate
mind without admitting them. But to know the ideas of a perfect
spirit is to participate his perfections; because to know his ideas is to know
them as they are, and to know them as they are is to perceive the evidence of
them. When, therefore, God shall communicate his ideas to us, <i>we shall be like
him</i>, by the conformity of our ideas to his.</p>

<p class='c006'>What are the ideas of God? They are clear in their nature; they are clear in
their images; they are perfect in their degree; they are complex in their relations;
and they are complete in their number. In all these respects the ideas of
God are infinitely superior to the ideas of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Men are full of <i>false</i> notions. Their ideas are often the very reverse of the
objects, of which they should be clear representations. We have false ideas in
physic, false ideas in policy, false ideas in religion. We have false ideas of honour
and of disgrace, of felicity and of misery. Hence we often mistake fancy
for reason, and shadow for substance. But God hath only <i>true</i> ideas. His idea
of order is an exact representation of order. His idea of irregularity exactly
answers to irregularity; and so of all other objects. He will make us know his
ideas, and by making us know them he will rectify ours.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Men have often <i>obscure</i> ideas. They only see glimmerings. They perceive
appearances rather than demonstrations. They are placed in a world of
probabilities, and, in consideration of this state, in which it has pleased the
Creator to place them, they have more need of a course of reasoning on a new
plan, to teach them how a rational creature ought to conduct himself, when he
is surrounded by probabilities, than of a course of reasoning and determining,
which supposes him surrounded with demonstration. But God hath only <i>clear</i>
ideas. No veil covers objects; no darkness obscure his ideas of them. When he
shall <i>appear</i>, he will communicate his ideas to us, and they will rectify ours, he
will cause the scales, that hide objects from us, to fall from our eyes; and he
will dissipate the clouds, which prevent our clear conception of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Men have very few ideas perfect in <i>degree</i>. They see only the surface of
objects. Who, in all the world, hath a perfect idea of matter? Who ever had
perfect ideas of spirit? Who could ever exactly define either? Who was ever
able to inform us how the idea of motion results from that of body; how the idea
of sensation results from that of spirit? Who ever knew to which class space
belongs? It would be very easy, my brethren, to increase this list, would time
permit; and were I not prevented by knowing, that they, who are incapable of
understanding these articles, have already in their own minds pronounced them
destitute of all sense and reason. But God hath <i>perfect</i> ideas. His ideas comprehend
the whole of all objects. He will communicate to us this disposition of
mind, and will give us such a penetration as shall enable us to attain the knowledge
of the essence of beings, and to contemplate them in their whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Men have very few ideas <i>complex</i> in their relations. I mean, their minds are
so limited, that, although they may be capable of combining a certain number
of ideas, yet they are confounded by combining a greater number. We have
distinct ideas of units, and we are capable of combining a few: but as soon as
we add hundred to hundred, million to million, the little capacity of our souls
is overwhelmed with the multitude of these objects, and our weakness obliges
us to sink under the weight. We have a few ideas of motion. We know what
space of body, to which a certain degree of velocity is communicated, must
pass through in a given time: but as soon as we suppose a greater degree of motion,
as soon as we imagine an augmentation of velocity to this greater degree;
as soon as we try to apply our knowledge of moving powers to those enormous
bodies, which the mighty hand of God guides in the immensity of space, we are
involved in perplexity and confusion. But God conceives <i>infinite combinations</i>.
He will make us participate, as far as our minds can, his ideas; so that we shall
be able to give a large expanse to our meditation without any fear of confusing
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. In fine, the ideas of mankind are incomplete in their <i>number</i>. Most men
think, there are only two sorts of beings, body and spirit; and they have also
determined, that there can be only two. A rash decision in itself: but more
rash still in a creature so confined in his genius as man. But the ideas of God
are <i>complete</i>. He knows all possible beings. He will make us participate this
disposition of mind, and from it may arise ideas of myriads of beings, on which
now we cannot reason, because now we have no ideas of them. A communication
of ideas is the first way, in which God will make himself known to us. This
will be the first trait of our resemblance of him. <i>We shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The second communication of God to a beatified soul is a communication of
love. We cannot possibly partake of the ideas of God without participating his
love. To participate the ideas of God is to possess just notions. To possess
just notions is to place each object in the rank, that is due to it; consequently,
we shall regard the chief being as the only object of supreme love.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is necessary to answer the idea, that an upright soul forms of the lovely?
The lovely object must answer three ideas: the idea of the great and marvellous;
the idea of the just; and the idea of the good: and, if I may venture to
speak so, of the beatifying. Now, it is impossible to know God without entertaining
these three ideas of him alone; consequently it is impossible to know
God without loving him. And this is the reason of our profound admiration of
the morality of the gospel. The morality of the gospel is the very quintessence
of order. It informs us, no creature deserves supreme love. It makes this
principle the substance of its laws. <i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind</i>, Matt. xxii. 37.</p>

<p class='c006'>How worthy of supreme love will this God appear, how fully will he answer
the idea of the <i>great</i> and the <i>marvellous</i>, when <i>we shall see him as he is</i>! He will
answer it by his independence. Creatures exist: but they have only a borrowed
being. God derives his existence from none. He is a self-existent being. He
will answer our idea of the magnificent by the immutability of his nature.
Creatures exist: but they have no fixed and permanent being. They arise from
nothing to existence. Their existence is rather variation and inconstancy than
real being. But God, but <i>I the Lord</i>, says he of himself, <i>I change not</i>, Mal. iii.
6. <i>the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever</i>, Heb. xiii. 8. He is, as it were, the
fixed point, on which all creatures revolve, while he is neither moved by their
motion, shaken by their action, nor in the least imaginable degree altered by all
their countless vicissitudes. He will answer the idea of the great and marvellous
by the efficiency of his will. Creatures have some efficient acts of violation:
but none of themselves.—But go back to that period, in which there was nothing.
Figure to yourselves those immense voids, which preceded the formation
of the universe, and represent to yourself God alone. He forms the plan of
the world. He regulates the whole design. He assigns an epoch of duration
to it in a point of eternity. This act of his will produces this whole universe.
Hence a sun, a moon, and stars. Hence earth and sea, rivers and fields. Hence
kings, princes, and philosophers. <i>He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and
it stood fast. The heavens were made by the word of the Lord, and all the host of
them by the breath of his mouth</i>, Psal. xxxiii. 9. God, then, perfectly answers our
idea of the grand and the marvellous. He answers also the idea of the just.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was he, who gave us an idea of <i>justice</i> or order. It was he, who made the
greatest sacrifices to it. It was he, who moved heaven and earth to re-establish
it, and who testified how dear it was to him by sacrificing the most worthy victim,
that could possibly suffer, I mean his only Son.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, God will perfectly answer our idea of the <i>good</i> and the <i>beatifying</i>.
Who can come up to it except a God, who opens to his creatures an access of
his treasures? A God, who reveals himself to them in order to take them away
from their <i>broken cisterns</i>, and to conduct them to a <i>fountain of living waters</i>,
Jer. ii. 13. A God, whose eternal wisdom cries to mankind, <i>Ho, every one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea
come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend
money for that, which is not bread? and your labour for that, which satisfieth not?
Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that, which is good, and let your soul delight
itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul
shall live.</i> Isa. lv. 1-3.</p>

<p class='c006'>We cannot, then, know God without loving him. And thus a communication
of ideas leads to a communication of love. But this communication of love will
render us <i>like</i> the God, whom we admire. For the property of love, in a soul
inflamed with it, is to transform it in some sort into the object of its admiration.
This is particularly proper to divine love. We love God, because we know his
attributes; when we know his attributes, we know, we can no better contribute
to the perfection of our being than by imitating them, and the desire we have to
perfect our being will necessitate us to apply wholly to imitate them, and to become
<i>like him</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us pass to our third consideration. The third communication of God to
a beatified soul is a communication of his <i>virtues</i>. To love and to obey, in Scripture-style,
is the same thing. <i>If ye love me, keep my commandments</i>, is a well-known
expression of Jesus Christ, John xiv. 15. <i>He, who saith I know him, and
keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him</i>, is an expression
of our apostle, 1 John ii. 4. This is not peculiar to the love of God. To
love and to obey, even in civil society, are usually two things, which have a
very close connexion. But, as no creature hath ever excited all the love, of which
a soul is capable, so there is no creature, to whom we have rendered a perfect
obedience. It is only in regard to God, that there is an inseparable connexion
between obedience and love. For when we love God, because we know him, we
are soon convinced, that he cannot ordain any thing to his creature but what is
useful to him; when we are convinced, he can ordain nothing to be performed by
his creature but what is useful to him, it becomes as impossible not to obey him
as it is not to love ourselves. To love and to obey is one thing, then, when the
object in question is a being supremely lovely. These are demonstrations; but
to obey God, and to keep his commandments, is to be <i>like God</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The commandments of God are formed on the idea of the divine perfections.
God hath an idea of order; he loves it; he follows it; and this is all he ever hath
required, and all he ever will require of his intelligent creatures. He requires
us to know order, to love it, to follow it. An intelligent creature, therefore, who
shall be brought to obey the commandments of God, will be <i>like God</i>. <i>Be ye
perfect, as your Father, which is in heaven, is perfect</i>, Matt. v. 48. <i>Be ye holy, for
I am holy</i>, 1 Pet. i. 16. <i>Every man, that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself
even as he is pure</i>, 1 John iii. 3. These precepts are given us here on earth, and
we obey them imperfectly now; but we shall yield a perfect obedience to them in
heaven, when we shall <i>see him as he is</i>. Here, our apostle affirms, <i>Whosoever
sinneth, hath not seen him, neither known him</i>, ver. 6. that is to say, he who suffers
sin to reign over him, doth not know God; for if he knew God, he would have
just ideas of God, he would love him; and, if he loved him, he would imitate
him. But in heaven we shall see, and know him, we shall not sin, we shall imitate
him, <i>we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, the fourth communication of the Deity with beatified souls is a communication
of <i>felicity</i>. In an economy of order, to be holy and to be happy are
two things very closely connected. Now we are in an economy of disorder.
Accordingly, virtue and felicity do not always keep company together, and it
sometimes happens, that for <i>having hope in Christ we are</i>, for a while, <i>of all men
most miserable</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 19. But this economy of disorder must be abolished.
Order must be established. St. Peter, speaking of Jesus Christ, says, <i>The heavens
must receive him until the times of the restitution of all things</i>, Acts iii. 21.
When all things shall be restored, virtue and happiness will be closely united,
and, consequently, by participating the holiness of God we shall participate his
happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is as just to say, that he destroys the <i>reason</i> of religion and piety, who
founds it upon the nature and existence of God, as to say, he saps the foundation
of moral obligations, who founds them upon the Will of God. And as religion
cannot be justly or solidly defended, but by shewing its connexion with, and dependance
upon, God’s existence; so neither can moral obligations be asserted
with strength and reason, but by shewing them to be the Will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may again be asked, Can God make that fit in <i>its self</i>, which is in <i>its self absolutely</i>
unfit to be done?</p>

<p class='c006'>This question consists of improper terms. For God’s Will no more makes actions
to be fit <i>in themselves</i>, than it makes <i>things</i> to exist <i>in, or of themselves</i>. No
things, nor any actions, have any <i>absolute</i> fitness, and in <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>A <i>gift</i>, a <i>blow</i>, the making a <i>wound</i>, or <i>shedding</i> of <i>blood</i>, considered in themselves,
have no <i>absolute</i> fitness, but are fit or unfit according to any variety of incidental
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>When therefore God, by his Will, makes any thing fit to be done, he does
not make the thing fit in <i>its self</i>, which is just in the <i>same state</i> considered in <i>its
self</i>, as it was before; but, it becomes fit for the person to do it, because he can
be happy, or do that which is fit for him to do, by doing the Will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>For instance, the <i>bare eating</i> a fruit, considered in <i>its self</i>, is neither fit nor unfit.
If a fruit be appointed by God for our food and nourishment, then it is as fit
to eat it, as to preserve our lives. If a fruit be poisonous, then it is as unfit to
eat it, as to commit self-murder. If eating of a fruit be prohibited by an express
order of God, then it is as unfit to eat it, as to eat our own damnation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in none of these instances is the eating or not eating, considered in <i>its self</i>,
<i>fit</i> or <i>unfit</i>; but has all its fitness, or unfitness, from such circumstances, as are
entirely owing to the Will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Supposing, therefore, God to require a person to do something, which, according
to his present circumstances, <i>without</i> that command, he ought not to do,
God does not make that which is <i>absolutely</i> unfit in <i>itself</i>, fit to be done; but only
adds <i>new circumstances</i> to an action, that is neither fit nor unfit, moral nor immoral
in <i>itself</i>, but <i>because</i> of its circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>To instance, in the case of <i>Abraham</i> required to sacrifice his son. The killing
of a man is neither good nor bad, considered <i>absolutely</i> in <i>its self</i>. It was unlawful
for <i>Abraham</i> to kill his son, because of the <i>circumstances</i> he was in with regard
to his son. But when the divine Command was given, <i>Abraham</i> was in a
<i>new state</i>; the action had <i>new circumstances</i>; and then it was as lawful for <i>Abraham</i>
to kill his son, as it was lawful for God to require any man’s life, either by
<i>sickness</i>, or any <i>other means</i> he should please to appoint.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it had been as unlawful for <i>Abraham</i> to have disobeyed God in this extraordinary
command, as to have cursed God at any <i>ordinary calamity</i> of providence.—</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is objected, <i>If there be nothing right or wrong, good or bad, antecedently
and independently of the Will of God, there can be no reason, why God should will,
or command one thing, rather than another</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is answered, <i>first</i>, That all goodness, and all possible perfection, is as <i>eternal</i>
as God, and as <i>essential</i> to him as his existence. And to say, that they are either
<i>antecedent</i> or <i>consequent</i>, <i>dependent</i> or <i>independent</i> of his Will, would be equally
absurd. To ask, therefore, whether there be not something right and wrong, antecedent
to the Will of God, to render his Will <i>capable</i> of being right, is as absurd,
as to ask for some antecedent cause of his existence, that he may be proved to
exist necessarily. And to ask, how God can be good, if there be not something
good independently of him, is asking how he can be infinite, if there be not something
infinite independently of him. And, to seek for any other <i>source</i> or <i>reason</i>
of the divine Goodness, besides the divine Nature, is like seeking for some external
cause, and help of the divine omnipotence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The goodness and wisdom, therefore, by which God is wise and good, and to
which all his works of wisdom and goodness are owing, are neither <i>antecedent</i>,
nor <i>consequent</i> to his Will.—”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r214'>214</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The devoting of a <i>seventh Part of Time</i> in a holy manner to the Lord, belongs
unchangeably to the <i>moral</i> nature and obligation of the <i>fourth Commandment</i>,
which is transferred in the New Testament, from the <i>seventh</i> to the <i>first</i> day of
the week. (See <i>John</i> xx. 26. and <i>Acts</i> xx. 7.) To this it may not be amiss to add
the judicious note of Mr. <i>Kennicott</i> in his dissertation on the oblations of <i>Cain</i>
and <i>Abel</i>, p. 184, 185, where he says, ‘The sabbath, or weekly day of holiness,
might well be called a <i>sign to the</i> Jews;’ for the <i>Jewish</i> sabbath was a <i>sign</i>, as
being founded on a double reason, the second of which (the <i>Egyptian</i> deliverance)
evidently distinguished that people from all others, and was therefore as
a sign constantly to remind them of the particular care of heaven, and what uncommon
returns of goodness they were to make for so signal a deliverance.
But there is great reason to believe, that the sabbath of the <i>Israelites</i> was altered
with their year, at their coming forth from <i>Egypt</i>; and a short attention to
this point may not be here improper, the case then seems to be this. At the
finishing of the creation, God sanctified the seventh day; this seventh day, being
the first day of <i>Adam’s</i> life, was consecrated by way of first-fruits to God; and
therefore <i>Adam</i> may reasonably be supposed to have <i>began</i> his computation of
the <i>days of the week</i> with the <i>first whole day</i> of his own existence; thus the sabbath
became the first day of the week; but when mankind fell from the worship
of the true God, they first substituted the worship of the sun, in his place, and
preserving the same weekly day of worship, but devoting it to the sun, the
sabbath was called <i>Sunday</i>; for that <i>Sunday</i> was the first day of the week, and
is so still in the east, is proved by Mr. <i>Selden</i> (Jus. Nat. and Gent. Lib. 3. Cap.
22.) Thus the <i>sabbath of the Patriarchs</i> continued to be the <i>Sunday of the idolaters</i>,
till the coming up of the <i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>; and then, as God altered
the beginning of their year, so he also changed the day of their worship from
<i>Sunday</i> to <i>Saturday</i>; the first reason of which might be, that as <i>Sunday</i> was the
day of worship among the Idolaters, the <i>Israelites</i> would be more likely to join
with them, if they rested on the same day, than if they were to work on that
day, and serve their God upon another. But a second reason certainly was, in
order to perpetuate the memory of <i>their deliverance on that day from</i> Egyptian
<i>slavery</i>; for <i>Moses</i>, when he applies the fourth Commandment to the particular
cases of his own people, <i>Deut.</i> v. 15, does not enforce it, as in <i>Ex.</i> xx. 11. by
the consideration of <i>God’s resting on that day</i> which was the sabbath of the
Patriarchs; but binds it upon them by saying, <i>Remember that thou wast a servant
in Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty
hand, and by a stretched-out arm; therefore the Lord thy God hath commanded</i>
<span class='fss'>THEE</span> <i>to keep this</i> <span class='fss'>SABBATH-DAY</span>. Allowing then the preceding observations, we
immediately see, how the sabbath naturally reverted to <i>Sunday</i>, after the abolition
of <i>Judaism</i> without any express command for the alteration. To which
he adds a quotation from Bp. <i>Cumberland</i>, (Orig. Gent. Antiq. p. 400.) which
speaks of the <i>Gentiles</i>, as called, after Christ’s time into the same universal
church with the Patriarchs; and another from <i>Justin Martyr</i>, Την δε του ηλιου
ημεραν κοινη παντες την συνελευσιν ποιουμεθα επειδη πρωτη εστιν ημερα, ενἡ ὁ θεος το σκοτος δε
την υλην τρεψας, κοσμον εποιησε και Ιησους Χριστος ὁ ημετερος σωτηρ τη αυτη ημερα εκ νεκρων
ανεστη. Apol c. s. 89. The purport of which is, that all Christians generally assembled
for religious worship on the <i>Sunday</i>; because it is the first day in
which God finished the creation of the world; and on the same day of the week,
Jesus Christ, our Saviour, rose from the dead.”</p>

that Father is not alone in his calling it Sunday; for Tertullian [Adv. Gent. Cap.</i>
xvi.] <i>calls it so. And Jerom says it may be so called, because the Sun of Righteousness
arose with healing in his wings; but it is generally called</i> the Lord’s day; <i>and
that not only by others, but by the same Fathers; except in their apologies for the
Christian religion against the Heathen, they used the word in compliance with their
mode of speaking. But that which is more strange, and savours a little of affectation,
is, that Justin, and some other of the Fathers, should chuse to use a circumlocution,
instead of Friday, as he calls it, the day before Saturday. And Ignatius, [in
Epist. ad Trall.] calls it</i> parasceva, <i>or, the preparation for the Sabbath, as the
Jews did; and Irenæus calls it the day before the Sabbath, [in Lib.</i> v. <i>adv. Her. Cap.</i>
xxiii.] <i>which the learned Grabe supposes to be for this reason; that they might shew
how much they detested the name of Venus, to whom Friday was dedicated by the
Heathen. And they ought to have been as cautious of using the word Sunday,
since that was not only dedicated to the Sun. But some took occasion from thence,
to asperse the Christians, as though they had worshipped the Sun; which Tertullian,
in [Apol. adv. Gen. Cap.</i> xvi.] <i>is obliged to exculpate them from.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
